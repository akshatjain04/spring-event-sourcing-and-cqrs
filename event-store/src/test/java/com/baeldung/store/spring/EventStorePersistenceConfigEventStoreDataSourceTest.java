================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: Sensitive data like username, password, database details might be exposed if they are passed as parameters in GET request to create the data source (DataSourceBuilder.create()).
Solution: Use POST instead of GET when passing sensitive information. Make sure all sensitive data is properly encrypted or hashed.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Issue: The DataSourceBuilder.create().build() did not explicitly define a data source URL, it might load configurations from application's properties files. If the configuration contains sensitive data and is not properly managed, there might be security threats.
Solution: Always separate sensitive configurations from others and use role-based access control (RBAC) to manage who can access those configurations. Always encrypt sensitive configurations.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: If username, password details are hardcoded in the DataSourceBuilder.create().build(), it may lead to security vulnerabilities like unauthorized access to database.
Solution: Never hard code credentials. Use a secure method recommended by Java like Java KeyStore or externalized configuration.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to verify DataSourceBuilder's creation and building

Details:  
  TestName: testDataSourceCreationAndBuilding.
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the DataSourceBuilder.create and build methods are working as expected, which create a new DataSourceBuilder and build it to a DataSource respectively.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to set up data, mocks, or test doubles as we are directly invoking the method.
    Act: Invoke the method eventStoreDataSource.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is not null and is an instance of DataSource.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the DataSourceBuilder.create and build methods are correctly creating and building a new DataSource. This test is crucial to ensure the DataSource interaction part of the application is functioning properly.


Scenario 2: Test for DataSource integrity

Details:  
  TestName: testDataSourceIntegrity.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the objects returned on invoking the method multiple times, are all distinct instances, ensuring the integrity of the DataSource.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to set up data, mocks, or test doubles as we are directly invoking the method.
    Act: Invoke the method eventStoreDataSource multiple times.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if each returned object has a different memory reference.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that new instances are created each time the method is invoked, preserving the DataSource integrity. The test underlines the independence of DataSource instances in the context of the application.

Scenario 3: Test to check the DataSource configuration

Details:  
  TestName: testDataSourceConfiguration.
  Description: This test aims to check if the DataSource returned by the DataSourceBuilder has configs matching our requirements or default configurations.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock DataSource with expected configurations.
    Act: Invoke the method eventStoreDataSource.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the configurations of the returned DataSource with the mock DataSource.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the DataSourceBuilder is using the correct configurations while building the DataSource. This test is important to ensure the DataSource can connect to the required database with the desired configurations.

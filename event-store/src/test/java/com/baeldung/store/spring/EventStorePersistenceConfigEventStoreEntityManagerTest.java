================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Hardcoded Configuration
Issue: The setPackagesToScan method specifies the package to scan for entity classes. If the package trees change or if new entity classes are added in different package trees during development, there's a risk of missing these entity classes because they're not being scanned.
Solution: Avoid hardcoding configuration details in the code. Consider using a property or configuration file to define these parameters and load them at runtime. This insulates the application from changes during the development cycle.

Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure
Issue: The properties used by the Hibernate JPA Vendor Adapter are retrieved from the environment without any mention of encryption or secure handling. If these properties include sensitive information like database details, their unsecured handling may expose them to malicious actors.
Solution: All sensitive data within the application should be encrypted and securely managed. Use Java's built-in security features along with best practices and established cryptographic libraries. Avoid storing sensitive information in the code or properties files, and instead use secure solutions like vaults or secure server parameters.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If the information retrieved via env.getProperty is used in a GET request or logged, it may reveal sensitive information.
Solution: Avoid storing sensitive information in plain text. Leverage Java's encryption libraries or consider using secure environment variables, which are not logged or exposed in monitoring tools.

Vulnerability: Potential Injection or XXE
Issue: If the values retrieved from env.getProperty contain user input or untrusted data, there may be a chance of SQL or XML entity injection.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize untrusted data. Use parameterized queries and prepared statements to avoid SQL injection attacks, and disable the use of external entities in XML parsing.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test with Valid Event Store Data Source

  Details:  
    TestName: testWithValidEventDataSource.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method eventStoreEntityManager() correctly utilizes a valid event store data source.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a mock eventStoreDataSource.
    Act: Invoke the method eventStoreEntityManager() on the mock data source.
    Assert: Assert that the LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean returned has the correct data source.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the returned LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean correctly utilized the given data source. This test is significant as it ensures the datasource initialization correctly initializes the EntityManagerFactory.

  Scenario 2: Test Invalid Event Store Data Source

  Details:  
    TestName: testWithInvalidEventDataSource.
    Description: This test checks how eventStoreEntityManager() behaves when given an invalid event store data source.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Setup an invalid eventStoreDataSource.
    Act: Call eventStoreEntityManager() using the invalid event store data source.
    Assert: Verify that an exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test confirms that an exception gets thrown when an invalid dataSource is provided to the eventStoreEntityManager() method. This is important to prevent incorrect setup of the EntityManagerFactory.

  Scenario 3: Test Correct Setting of VendorAdapter
  
  Details:
    TestName: testCorrectVendorAdapter
    Description: This test validates that the HibernateJpaVendorAdapter is correctly set up for the EntityManagerFactory.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock HibernateJpaVendorAdapter.
    Act: Call eventStoreEntityManager() and then fetch the Hibernate vendor adapter on the returned object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned HibernateJpaVendorAdapter matches the one set in the method.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the correct HibernateJpaVendorAdapter is set in the eventStoreEntityManager(). It is critical for ensuring compatibility with Hibernate and correct JPA functionality.

  Scenario 4: Test Correct Population of Hibernate Properties
  
  Details:
    TestName: testHibernatePropertiesPopulation
    Description: This test checks that the method correctly Populates Hibernate properties from the environment.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the environment to return a set of properties when getProperties("spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto") and getProperties("spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect") is called.
    Act: Call eventStoreEntityManager() and fetch the JPA property map.
    Assert: Assert that the property map contains correct properties.
  Validation:
    This validation tests that Hibernate properties are correctly populated from the environment variables. This is important for ensuring correct configuration of the EntityManagerFactory.

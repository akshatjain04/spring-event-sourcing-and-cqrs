================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Possibility of null UUID passed as parameter
Issue: By allowing null UUID to be passed as a parameter to a function, there could be a risk of NullPointerException, which can ultimately throw an exception and terminate the execution of your program.
Solution: Add a null check in the method to ensure the UUID passed as parameter is not null.

Vulnerability: UUID Parameter tempering
Issue: If the ID parameter can be manipulated by an untrusted client, the application could be exploited to access unauthorized information or perform unauthorized actions.
Solution: Make sure to validate all parameters, including UUIDs, especially if they're used in security-sensitive operations like access controls or database queries. This applies even if you think the parameter can't be manipulated by the client.

Vulnerability: Immutable Objects Cache
Issue: UUID is an immutable object and can be used for caching which may lead to memory over consumptions.
Solution: Instead of using UUID as the key for caches, use some other data types or indexes which are memory efficient.

"""
  Scenario 1: Normal UUID Test

  Details:  
    TestName: setIdOfLeadValidUUID.
    Description: The test is meant to check if the setIdOfLead method successfully sets the idOfLead variable to a valid UUID.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a UUID object with a valid UUID value.
    Act: Invoke the setIdOfLead method with the created UUID.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual result(idOfLead) against expected UUID.
  Validation: 
    The assertion intends to verify if the idOfLead variable is set correctly. It checks the correct functionality of the setIdOfLead method when provided a valid UUID. It ensures that the method updates the idOfLead correctly which is significant for any operations reliant on this ID.

  Scenario 2: Null UUID Test

  Details:  
    TestName: setIdOfLeadNullUUID.
    Description: The test is meant to check if the setIdOfLead method handles null UUID appropriately, without exception.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the UUID object to null.
    Act: Invoke the setIdOfLead method with a null value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result(idOfLead) against null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the idOfLead variable is set to null. It checks the setIdOfLead method's appropriate handling of a null situation. This is significant as it preserves the stability and fault tolerance of the application.

  Scenario 3: Different UUID Test

  Details:  
    TestName: setIdOfLeadDifferentUUID.
    Description: The test is meant to check if the setIdOfLead method successfully updates the idOfLead variable when given a different UUID.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two UUID objects with different values.
    Act: Invoke the setIdOfLead method first with the first UUID, then with the second.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result(idOfLead) against the second UUID.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the idOfLead variable is updated correctly. It checks the setIdOfLead method's correct functionality when provided a different UUID after the idOfLead has been set once already. It validates the method's ability to correctly update the idOfLead, which is significant for any operations related to updating the lead.

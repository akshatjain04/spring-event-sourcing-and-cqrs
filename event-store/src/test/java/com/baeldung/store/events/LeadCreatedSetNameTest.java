"""
  Scenario 1: Test for valid name value

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetNonNullName.
    Description: In this test scenario, we are verifying that the setName function is able to handle a non-null name parameter correctly. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a class instance that has the setName method. 
    Act: Invoke the setName method with a non-null and valid value such as "John Doe". 
    Assert: Verify if the name field of the class instance became "John Doe".
  Validation: 
    This test is aiming to verify that the setName method can correctly set the name field with a valid value. The expected result is that the name field became "John Doe", based on standard Java field setting operation. 

  """
  
"""
  Scenario 2: Test for null name value

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetNullName.
    Description: In this test scenario, we are verifying that the setName function is able to handle a null name parameter correctly. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a class instance that has the setName method. 
    Act: Invoke the setName method with a null value. 
    Assert: Verify if the name field of the class instance became null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the setName method can correctly set the name field with a null value. The expected result is that the name field became null, based on standard Java field setting operation.

  Scenario 3: Test for empty string name value

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetEmptyName.
    Description: In this test scenario, we are verifying that the setName is able to handle an empty string name parameter correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a class instance that has the setName method.
    Act: Invoke the setName method with an empty string value. 
    Assert: Verify if the name field of the class instance became an empty string.
  Validation:
    This test aims to verify that the setName function can set the name field with an empty string value. The expected result is that the field became an empty string, based on standard Java field setting operation.

  Scenario 4: Test for name value with spaces 

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetNameWithSpaces.
    Description: In this test scenario, we are verifying that the setName is able to handle a name parameter with spaces correctly. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a class instance that has the setName method.  
    Act: Invoke the setName method with a string value which includes spaces, such as "   John Doe  ".
    Assert: Verify if the name field of the class instance became "   John Doe  ".
  Validation:
    This test aims to verify that the setName function can set the name field with a string value which includes spaces. The expected result is that the field became "   John Doe  ", based on standard Java field setting operation.

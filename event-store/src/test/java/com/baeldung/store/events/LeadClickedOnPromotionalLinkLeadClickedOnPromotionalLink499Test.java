  Scenario 1: Valid UUID Test 
  Details:  
    TestName: testValidUUID
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method is correctly handling and storing valid UUID input. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide a valid UUID as input
    Act: Invoke the LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink method with the valid UUID.
    Assert: The UUID provided as input should be the same as the idOfLead private variable.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles valid UUIDs. If the input UUID is not stored as the idOfLead, functionality relying on correct ID storage may fail.

   Scenario 2: Null UUID Test 
   Details:  
    TestName: testNullUUID
    Description: This test checks the method's error handling when provided with a null UUID.
   Execution:
    Arrange: Provide a null UUID as input
    Act: Invoke the LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink method with the null UUID.
    Assert: Method should throw appropriate exception.
   Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method properly handles null UUIDs by throwing an exception, thus ensuring stability of the program.

   Scenario 3: Different UUID Test 
   Details:  
    TestName: testDifferentUUID
    Description: This test ensures that the method correctly overwrites the previous UUID with a new one.
   Execution:
    Arrange: Provide two different valid UUIDs.
    Act: Invoke the LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink method first with one UUID and then with another.
    Assert: The second UUID should be stored as idOfLead, replacing the first one.
   Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly overwrites previous UUID with a new one. This is important for updating lead information.

    Scenario 4: Invalid UUID Test 
    Details:  
     TestName: testInvalidUUID
     Description: This test checks the method's error handling when provided with an invalid UUID.
    Execution:
     Arrange: Provide an invalid UUID as input (i.e. non-UUID string or non-string data type).
     Act: Invoke the LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink method with the invalid UUID.
     Assert: Method should throw appropriate exception.
    Validation: 
     The assertion verifies that the method properly filters out invalid UUIDs and does not store them. This prevents potential errors when referencing this lead ID.

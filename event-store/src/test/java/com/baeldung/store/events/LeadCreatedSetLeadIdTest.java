ROOST_METHOD_HASH=setLeadId_26fb0b5ac7
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=setLeadId_6d276e1019

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insufficient Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: Your setter method 'setLeadId(UUID leadId)' doesn't validate the provided input. Malformed or malicious inputs can cause runtime errors, or potentially be used to exploit other vulnerabilities.
Solution: Consider adding validation checks for the input parameters of the function 'setLeadId(UUID leadId)'. This might include null-checks, format verification, or even specific business rule validation.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid UUID set as Lead ID 
  Details:  
    TestName: validUuidSetAsLeadId.
    Description: This test is meant to verify the setLeadId method, by passing a valid UUID as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid UUID.
    Act: Invoke setLeadId method with the valid UUID. 
    Assert: Verify that leadId field now has the same UUID.
  Validation: 
    We aim to confirm that when a valid UUID is set as leadId, the field is updated correctly. This is important for maintaining accurate tracking of leads.

Scenario 2: Null UUID set as Lead ID
  Details:  
    TestName: nullUuidSetAsLeadId.
    Description: This test verifies that the setLeadId method handles a null UUID without causing a NullPointerException.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a null UUID.
    Act: Invoke setLeadId method with the null UUID. 
    Assert: Assert that the leadId field is now null.
  Validation: 
    This test ensures that the setLeadId method can effectively handle null inputs without breaking the software, which is crucial for software robustness.

Scenario 3: Change of LeadID from valid UUID to another valid UUID
  Details:  
    TestName: changeLeadIdFromValidUuidToAnother.
    Description: This test verifies that the setLeadId method allows for effective changes of LeadID from one valid UUID to another. It helps to account for situations such as lead transfers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two valid UUIDs - UUID1 and UUID2, and set leadId as UUID1.
    Act: Invoke setLeadId method with UUID2. 
    Assert: Assert that leadId field is now UUID2.
  Validation: 
    We aim to verify that the setLeadId method allows for effective changes of LeadID, which is necessary for situations such as corrections or lead transfers.  

Scenario 4: Same UUID set multiple times
  Details:  
    TestName: sameUuidSetMultipleTimes.
    Description: Is to test the idempotency of the setLeadId method. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid UUID and set it as leadId.
    Act: Invoke the setLeadId method with the same UUID multiple times.
    Assert: Confirm that the leadId remains the same after multiple invocations.
  Validation: 
    This test checks that the method behaves idempotently by not causing any change when the same input is provided multiple times. This is an important feature of methods that set particular variables.

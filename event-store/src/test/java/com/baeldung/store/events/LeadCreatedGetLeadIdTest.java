ROOST_METHOD_HASH=getLeadId_10b05e9f14
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getLeadId_87b8008c69

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: None apparent from provided code snippet
Issue: None. The given code is only a getter method for retrieving UUID of a lead, without modifying any data or executing vulnerable operations (like IO operations, string manipulation, etc.).
Solution: No solution needed. Keep following safe coding practices and review potential security implications when implementing other features.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to check if the getLeadId method is returning the correct Lead ID.

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLeadId.
  Description: This test is meant to verify that the getLeadId method is returning the correct UUID assigned as leadId. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class and set a UUID as the leadId. 
  Act: Call the getLeadId method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the returned leadId matches the expected UUID.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to validate that the getLeadId method is returning the correct UUID assigned as leadId. This is essential to ensure that our applications are working correctly and can identify and return the right ID when needed.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method returns null when leadId is not assigned.

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLeadIdWithoutAssigning.
  Description: This test ensures that the getLeadId method can handle situations where no leadId has been assigned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class without assigning a leadId.
  Act: Invoke the getLeadId method.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns null.
Validation: 
  The validation of this test ensures that the application correctly handles situations where no leadId has been assigned and returns null in such cases. This prevents the application from causing errors or crashes when dealing with null values.

Scenario 3: Test if the getLeadId method is thread-safe.

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLeadIdThreadSafety.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the getLeadId function behaves correctly under multithreading conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Make multiple threads call the getLeadId method simultaneously.
  Act: Invoke the getLeadId method from multiple threads.
  Assert: Assert that all threads retrieve the same leadId.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify the thread-safety of the getLeadId method. The importance of this test lies in confirming that the application is stable and performs as expected in a multi-threaded environment.

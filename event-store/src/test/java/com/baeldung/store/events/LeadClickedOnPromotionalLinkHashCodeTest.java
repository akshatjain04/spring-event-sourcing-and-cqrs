================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: If the hash function is used as a direct object reference in a larger system, using predictable values can allow an attacker to predict future values and carry out attacks.
Solution: Always use a truly random value as initial seed and ensure that the random number generator is properly seeded. Consider using java.security.SecureRandom instead of java.util.Random.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: This hashCode() implementation may result in a NullPointException, impacting the normal operation of the program.
Solution: Always perform null checks before accessing methods on objects. Javaâ€™s Optional can be used to avoid null checks, reducing null pointer exceptions.

Vulnerability: CWE-667: Improper Locking
Issue: If the hashCode() method is used in a multi-threading context, it may cause data race or other synchronization problems as it is not thread safe.
Solution: Ensure methods which modify shared data are properly synchronized. If possible, exploit the use of thread-safe classes and libraries provided by Java.

"""
  Scenario 1: Testing the hashCode() method with a non-null idOfLead
  Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithNonNullIdOfLead
    Description: This test will verify the specific functionality of hashCode() method when the idOfLead variable is not null.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Have an idOfLead variable initialized with a UUID.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode() method and compute the hash value.
    Assert: The computed hash value must be equal to the hash of the UUID times the prime number.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that when the idOfLead variable is not null, its hashcode value is equal to the hash of the UUID times the prime number. 
    This is significant as it ensures object distinction and appropriate handling in collections like HashMap, HashSet.

  Scenario 2: Testing the hashCode() method with a null idOfLead
  Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithNullIdOfLead
    Description: This test will verify the hashCode() method's behavior when the idOfLead variable is null.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the idOfLead variable to null.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode() method.
    Assert: The returned hash value must be equal to the prime number.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to validate that the hashcode method can handle null values for the idOfLead variable and returns prime number as the result instead. 
    This is important in ensuring non-duplication when storing objects in collections that use the hashcode method.
    
  Scenario 3: Testing the hashCode() method with two different non-null idOfLead
  Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithDifferentNonNullIdOfLead
    Description: This test will verify the functionality of the hashCode() method when provided two different non-null idOfLead.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize two UUIDs and set as idOfLead.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode() method for both UUIDs.
    Assert: The computed hash values should be different for both UUIDs.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode() correctly distinguishes between different non-null idOfLeads.
    This is crucial for the correct functioning of collections and to avoid object misidentification.

  Scenario 4: Testing the hashCode() method with two identical non-null idOfLead
  Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithIdenticalNonNullIdOfLead
    Description: This test will verify the functionality of the hashCode() method when provided with two identical non-null idOfLead. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an UUID and set as idOfLead for two instances.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode() method for both instances.
    Assert: The computed hash values should be identical for both instances.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode() correctly identifies identical non-null idOfLeads.
    This is crucial for the correct functioning of collections and to avoid object duplication.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-248: Uncaught Exception
Issue: This piece of code doesn't include a try/catch block, leaving it vulnerable to uncaught exceptions that leads to abnormal termination of the program.
Solution: Include a try/catch block around the code and handle exceptions appropriately.

Vulnerability: CWE-579: J2EE Bad Practices: Non-serializable Object Stored in Session
Issue: In the event that the `LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink` object is stored in a session, it is crucial to ensure that sessions are serializable to prevent loss of user state. Current code doesn't implement serializable which may lead to session replication issues.
Solution: Make the `LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink` class to implement `java.io.Serializable` interface to mitigate this security risk.

Vulnerability: CWE-470: Unconstrained Casting
Issue: This code doesn't check if `obj` is an instance of `LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink` before casting, this can lead to ClassCastException at runtime. The exception handling is not adequate.
Solution: Before casting, check if `obj` is an instance of `LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink`. If it's not, return false or handle the potential class casting issue appropriately within a try/catch block.

""" 
Scenario 1: Test Equality with the Same Object

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualityWithSameObject.
  Description: This test checks the equals method when the object being compared is the same object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink.
    Act: Invoke equals with the same object as a parameter. 
    Assert: Assert that the result is True.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return true if the same object is compared. This validates the reflexivity property of the equals method.

Scenario 2: Test Equality with Null Object

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualityWithNullObject.
  Description: This test checks the equals method when the object being compared is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink.
    Act: Invoke equals with null as an argument.
    Assert: Assert that the result is False.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return false when compared with null. This validates the non-nullity property of the equals method.

Scenario 3: Test Equality with Different Class Object

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentClassObject.
  Description: This test checks the equals method when the object compared is not of the same class.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink and instance another class.
    Act: Invoke equals with different classâ€™ object as parameter. 
    Assert: Assert that the result is False.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return false if the compared object is not from the same class.

Scenario 4: Test Equality with Same idOfLead

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualityWithSameIdOfLead.
  Description: This test checks the equals method when the idOfLead is the same between two different objects 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two different instances of LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink with same idOfLead.
    Act: Invoke equals with the other object as parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result is True.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return true if the compared object has the same idOfLead.

Scenario 5: Test Equality with Different idOfLead

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentIdOfLead.
  Description: This test checks the equals method when the idOfLead is different between two objects. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two different instances of LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink with different idOfLead.
    Act: Invoke equals with the other object as parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result is False.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return false if the compared object has a different idOfLead.

Scenario 6: Test Equality when idOfLead is null in the compared object 

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualityWhenIdOfLeadIsNullInComparedObject.
  Description: This test checks the equals method when idOfLead is null in the compared object. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink and another instance of LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink with null idOfLead.
    Act: Invoke equals with the other object as parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result is False.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return false if the compared object has a null idOfLead.

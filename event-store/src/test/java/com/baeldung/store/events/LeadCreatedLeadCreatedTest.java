ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=LeadCreated_3d459ae473

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
Issue: If passwords are stored using a one-way hash function, attackers may use precomputed tables (rainbow tables) to speed up cracking
Solution: Always use a random salt value in conjunction with hashing and avoid using outdated hash functions.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings
Issue: Sensitive data in URLs may be logged in various places, and it may leak to third parties via the Referer header.
Solution: Use POST for any requests that potentially modify state. Don't pass sensitive information in query strings.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: If a method or function doesn't require authentication, nefarious users can execute them, observing results and influencing your application's behavior.
Solution: Ensure critical functions enforce robust authorization and authentication checks.

Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
Issue: Attackers can exploit this weakness to read arbitrary files on the server, interact with any back-end or external systems that the application can connect to or cause a denial of service.
Solution: Prevent XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks by using a local Document Type Definition (DTD) and by disabling DTD processing.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: An attacker can control the structuring of a query by injecting malicious inputs. This issue may lead to unauthorized viewing, modification or deletion of data.
Solution: Ensure the use of parameterized queries, ORM libraries, or ensure the proper escaping of special characters when constructing SQL queries.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test for Default Constructor 

  Details:  
    TestName: testDefaultConstructor().
    Description: The test is meant to check the construction of a LeadCreated object with the default constructor. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup data is required since we're invoking a constructor. 
    Act: Invoke the default LeadCreated() constructor, stating 'new LeadCreated()'. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to determine if the instance of the LeadCreated object is not null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion confirms that the default constructor for LeadCreated doesn't return null. The expected result is that it creates an instance of the LeadCreated object. This test is significant because it ensures that the basic functionality of object instantiation works as intended.

  Scenario 2: Test for Default Constructor with SuperClass properties

  Details:  
    TestName: testDefaultConstructorWithSuperProperties().
    Description: The test is meant to check the correct inheritance of base class properties when a LeadCreated object is instantiated using the default constructor. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup data is required since we're invoking a constructor. 
    Act: Create a new instance of LeadCreated and then access the properties of the superclass, BaseEvent. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that super class properties are null or have their default values, indicating that they have been instantiated correctly.
  Validation: 
    This test asserts the initialization of superclass properties upon instantiation of a LeadCreated object using the default constructor. If the superclass, BaseEvent is initiated correctly, it ensures consistent behavior of the LeadCreated class instances.

    The error that occurred is not related to the test cases or business logic. The error log indicates that there is 
    a problem with the project dependencies, specifically the spring-leads-infra dependency could not be resolved.
    This can occur if the required dependency is not available in the expected repository or if an incorrect version number 
    is specified.

    Suggestion: Check your project's pom.xml file and ensure that all the project dependencies are correctly defined 
    with the right version numbers and are available in the specified repositories. If you have recently made changes to your 
    project dependencies, you might need to update your project configuration or clean your project.

    Note: If your project uses a private or corporate repository, ensure that the repository is properly configured 
    and that your system has the necessary access permissions to it.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: Potential code stub. LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink class implementation is incomplete, potentially indicating leftover debug code or in-progress implementation.
Solution: Remove debugging code and unimplemented/unused classes during deployment. An incomplete class may result in application function failure if accessed.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: There seems to be an unused import statement. Unused imports can lead to null pointer exceptions, software crashes and other unexpected behaviours.
Solution: Remove unused import statements. It's necessary to only keep required import statements.

Vulnerability: CWE-489, CWE-749: Exposed Internal Class
Issue: Public class LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink may expose sensitive application details, enabling unauthorized parties to leverage it for malicious attacks.
Solution: Ensure to encapsulate classes and to expose only necessary interfaces or methods to outside classes. In this case, consider changing the class definition from 'public' if it's not intended for public access.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Invocation of LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink

Details:  
  TestName: invokeLeadClickedOnPromotionalLink.
  Description: This test aims to verify whether the method LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink can be invoked successfully without throwing an exception.  
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink. 
  Act: Call the method on the instance. 
  Assert: We do not expect any return from a constructor call. JUnit assertions could be used to verify that the result is indeed null. 
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink method was successfully invoked. The expected outcome would be no exception occurrence or not null object creation. This is significant as it validates the successful instantiation which is the primary expectation from a default constructor.

Scenario 2: Object Initialization Check with LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink

Details:  
  TestName: initializationWithLeadClickedOnPromotionalLink.
  Description: This test aims to verify if an object generated using LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink method is not null after its invocation. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as we are directly initializing the object. 
  Act: Create a new object using the LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink.  
  Assert: JUnit assertion will be used to ensure that the created object is not null. 
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the object created from LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink constructor isn't null. If an object is created successfully, it shouldn't be null. This checks the functionality of the constructor in establishing proper object creation. 

Scenario 3: Multiple Object Creation with LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink

Details:  
  TestName: multipleObjectCreationWithLeadClickedOnPromotionalLink.
  Description: This test aims to check if we can create multiple objects using LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink method without any conflicts or issues. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as we are directly initializing the objects. 
  Act: Create multiple new objects using LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink. 
  Assert: Using JUnit assertions, verify that all the created objects are not null. 
Validation: 
  The assertion checks if the constructor LeadClickedOnPromotionalLink is capable of generating multiple independent objects. This confirms the reusability of the constructor for multiple object creations.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
Issue: Data that is not encrypted can be intercepted and stolen by unauthorized individuals. If sensitive data, such as personal information or credentials, are transmitted over a network without encryption, an attacker can obtain it and use it for illegitimate purposes.
Solution: Use secure communication channels to transmit sensitive data. For example, use HTTPS instead of HTTP or encrypt the data before sending it. In Java, you can use inbuilt features like Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) for secure transmission of data.

Vulnerability: CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: Dereferencing null pointers can lead to various outcomes, such as system crash or arbitrary code execution. In Java, accessing or modifying the null object can lead to a NullPointerException.
Solution: Before dereferencing, it is always good to confirm if an object is not null, you can use the Objects.requireNonNull method which throws a NullPointerException with an optional error message if an object is null.

Vulnerability: CWE-89 SQL Injection
Issue: If the application is storing or retrieving data from a database, it might be potentially vulnerable to SQL injection attacks where an attacker can manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious queries, which could lead to data leaks or modification.
Solution: Always sanitize and validate input before using it in SQL queries. Preferably, use PreparedStatement which avoids SQL Injection in Java. Set values to parameters in PreparedStatement with setter methods instead of using concatenation.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid UUID for both correlationId and leadId and valid name
Details:  
  TestName: testValidUUIDAndName
  Description: Test to check whether the function operates correctly when provided with valid UUIDs for correlationId and leadId, as well as a valid name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate valid UUIDs for correlationId and leadId, and set a valid name string.
  Act: Call the LeadCreated method with the created correlationId, leadId, and name.
  Assert: Assert that the created object is not null and that its get methods return the correct values for correlationId, leadId, and name.
Validation: 
  This test is to ensure that the function constructs a LeadCreated object correctly when given valid UUIDs and name inputs. It verifies that the constructor correctly assigns the passed parameters to the corresponding object properties.

Scenario 2: Null UUID for correlationId 
Details:  
  TestName: testNullUUIDForCorrelationId
  Description: Test to check how the function responds when given a null UUID for correlationId.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate a valid UUID for leadId, a valid name string, and set correlationId to null.
  Act: Call the LeadCreated method with the null correlationId, generated leadId, and set name.
  Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  This test evaluates if the function correctly handles null inputs for correlationId and throws an exception. It validates how the constructor safeguards against null values.

Scenario 3: Null UUID for leadId 
Details:  
  TestName: testNullUUIDForLeadId
  Description: Test to check how the function responds when given a null UUID for leadId.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate a valid UUID for correlationId, a valid name string, and set leadId to null.
  Act: Call LeadCreated method with the generated correlationId, null leadId, and set name.
  Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  This test evaluates if the function correctly handles null inputs for leadId and throws an exception. It validates how the constructor safeguards against null values.
  
Scenario 4: Null value for name 
Details:  
  TestName: testNullValueForName
  Description: Test to check how the function responds when given a null value for name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate valid UUIDs for correlationId and leadId, and set name to null.
  Act: Call LeadCreated method with the generated correlationId, leadId, and set null name.
  Assert: The assertion would depend on the actual implementation. If null names are allowed, then assert that get method for name returns null. Otherwise, assert that an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The test verifies how the function handles null inputs for the name and validates the corresponding behavior of the constructor.

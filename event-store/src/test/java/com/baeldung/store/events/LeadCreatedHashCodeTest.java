================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Hash Function (CWE-328)
Issue: A weak or vulnerable hash function may lead to several security problems such as collision and preimage attacks, especially when handling sensitive data or when used in security mechanisms such as password hashing.
Solution:  In this case, the hash function itself (hashCode) isn't vulnerable. But, it would be better to ensure it's used properly to avoid security risks. Ensure that hashCode is used only for its intended purpose of data structures and not applied to security critical information.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Validating hashCode for Unique LeadId and Name

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeForUniqueLeadIdAndName
  Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method when both leadId and name are unique. It will verify that the hashCodes generated are unique for every unique combination of leadId and Name.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two different leadIds and names, use UUID to ensure unique leadIds.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method by passing the generated leadIds and names, and capture the returned hashCodes.
    Assert: Assert that the hashCodes generated by each unique combination of leadId and name are different.
  Validation:
    Checking that for every unique combination of leadId and name, the returned hashCode is different. This behavior is significant for hashing in data structures like HashMap, HashSet etc.

Scenario 2: Validating hashCode for null LeadId and Name

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeForNullLeadIdAndName
  Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method when both leadId and name are null. It will verify that the hashCode handles null values correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a null leadId and name.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method by passing the null leadId and name, and capture the returned hashCode.
    Assert: Assert that the returned hashCode is 1, as for null inputs the method should return default value of result.
  Validation:
    Ensuring that the hashCode method can handle null values correctly without throwing any exceptions. This is crucial since NullPointerException can disrupt the application flow.

Scenario 3: Validating hashCode for identical LeadId and Name

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeForIdenticalLeadIdAndName
  Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method when leadId and name are identical. It validates that the hashCode generated is same for the same leadId and name pairs. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create similar pairs of leadId and name.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method by passing the identical leadId and name pairs, and capture the returned hashCodes.
    Assert: Assert that the hashCodes generated by identical pairs of leadId and name, are identical.
  Validation: 
    Validate that the hashCode method returns identical hashCode for identical pairs of leadId and name. This confirms the uniqueness of the hashCode for unique data and non-unique for non-unique data.

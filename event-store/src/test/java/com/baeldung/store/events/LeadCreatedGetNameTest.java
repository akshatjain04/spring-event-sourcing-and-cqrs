================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: If an application uses untrusted input in a SQL statement, an attacker can change the structure of the query to access unauthorized data, modify data or even execute system commands.
Solution: Use prepared statements, parameterized queries or stored procedures instead of building dynamic SQL statements. Input validation and escaping is also recommended.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: Occurs if an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with a user-supplied input using a browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript.
Solution: Use frameworks that automatically escape XSS by design, encode data on output at the server side or update the page properly using JavaScript.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: Verbose error messages can expose system-level details to the user which can be exploited by an attacker.
Solution: Display generic error messages to the end user. Detailed error messages should only be logged for developers or administrators.

Vulnerability: CWE-319: Plaintext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Issue: Sensitive data must be encrypted in transit to protect from man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Otherwise, an attacker can eavesdrop the network and steal the information.
Solution: Ensure sensitive data is transmitted over a secure channel (e.g., HTTPS).

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test For Correct Name Retrieval

  Details:  
    TestName: testCorrectNameRetrieval
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getName() method correctly returns the name of the object. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object with a specific name.
    Act: Invoke the getName() method on the created object. 
    Assert: Assert that the returned name is equal to the name set while creating the object.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the getName() method correctly retrieves the name of the object. The expected result is the name that was set during object creation. This is crucial as it verifies the core functionality of the getName() method.

Scenario 2: Test For Name Case Sensitivity

  Details:  
    TestName: testNameCaseSensitivity
    Description: This test checks if the getName() method distinguishes names with different case sensitivity. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two objects, one with a name in lowercase and the other in uppercase.
    Act: Invoke the getName() method on both objects.
    Assert: Assert that the returned names are not deemed equal, maintaining case sensitivity.
  Validation: 
    This test aims to verify that the getName() method respects case sensitivity in names. The expectation is that the method does not treat same names with different cases as equal. This is significant as it reflects the proper handling of string values in the system.

Scenario 3: Test When Name Is Null

  Details:  
    TestName: testWhenNameIsNull
    Description: This test is to check the behavior of the getName() method when the name of the object is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object without setting a name.
    Act: Invoke the getName() method on the created object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned name is null.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the getName() method gracefully handles situations where the object's name is null and correctly returns null. It's significant in the sense that the method should not throw exceptions but handle any null object scenarios gracefully. 

Scenario 4: Test Name With Special Characters

  Details:  
    TestName: testNameWithSpecialCharacters
    Description: This test is to check how the getName() method handles names with special characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object with a name that includes special characters.
    Act: Invoke the getName() method on the created object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned name equals the name set, including the special characters.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the getName() method can correctly return names with special characters. It is critical as it confirms the program's ability to handle special characters in names.

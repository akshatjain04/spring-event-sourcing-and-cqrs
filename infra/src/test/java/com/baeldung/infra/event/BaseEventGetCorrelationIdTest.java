================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of insufficiently random values
Issue: If the returned UUID of getCorrelationId() method is used in security sensitive context, it should be known that UUIDs are not meant to be used for security sensitive purposes as they are predictable and can be brute-forced.
Solution: If security is a concern, consider using secure random ID, cryptographic in nature, instead of a UUID.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: In case the correlationId holds sensitive data, this method exposes it which might lead to information leakage.
Solution: Ensure the data returned doesn't violate the user's privacy or consider encapsulating the data into an object which doesn't directly expose private information.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Exposing correlationId might provide an attacker with valuable information about the state of the application.
Solution: Consider if it's necessary to expose this information, or if it could be encapsulated better, e.g. providing a method that just returns a boolean if the values correlate instead of the value itself.

""" 
Scenario 1: Testing correlationId UUID is not null

Details:  
  TestName: testCorrelationIdIsNotNull
  Description: This test is meant to verify if the getCorrelationId method is returning a non-null UUID. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as no parameters are used for the method.
  Act: Invoke the getCorrelationId method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned UUID is not null.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the correlationId is correctly set and the getCorrelationId method works properly. If the method returns null, it signifies a failure in setting the correlationId. It's critical in the context of application behavior as it ensures the method is returning a valid UUID.

Scenario 2: Testing correlationId UUID is Unique

Details:  
  TestName: testCorrelationIdIsUnique
  Description: This test is meant to verify if the getCorrelationId method returns a unique UUID upon each execution. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No prior arrangement is required since no parameters are passed to the method.
  Act: Invoke the getCorrelationId method twice. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare if the two returned UUIDs are different.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to ensure that each time the getCorrelationId method is invoked, a unique UUID is returned, ensuring proper tracking of different method executions. It could be crucial in the application logic, for instance, in tracking individual requests or operations.

Scenario 3: Testing correlationId UUID Format

Details:  
  TestName: testCorrelationIdFormat
  Description: This test is designed to validate that the getCorrelationId method returns UUID in the correct format. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No prior setup is required as the method does not require any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getCorrelationId method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate the format of the returned UUID matches the expected pattern.
Validation: 
  This assertion ensures that the returned UUID adheres to the correct format. If the UUID is in the correct format, it can be used properly across the application for correlation or other necessary purposes.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch
Issue: Java applications using SSL/TLS to secure transmitted data can be susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks if they do not properly validate that the connected server's certificate matches the expected host.
Solution: Standard libraries such as JSSE provide built-in options for hostname verification. These should be used instead of custom validation code, which is much more prone to implementation errors. 

Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: Applications that deserialize unverified data can be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution attacks. This can lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure vulnerabilities.
Solution: Verification or sanitization of untrusted data prior to deserialization can mitigate this risk. Alternatively, use of safe deserialization APIs or libraries that do not permit arbitrary object creation can be used.

Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
Issue: Applications using XML parsing libraries which allow XML External Entity (XXE) references can be vulnerable to information disclosure or denial of service attacks.
Solution: Disable or restrict external entities in XML parsing. Use of less complex data formats such as JSON can also eliminate this risk.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: Excessive information in error messages exposed to the user can aid attackers in understanding the internal workings of the system.
Solution: Implement a system to classify and handle errors, ensuring sensitive information is logged appropriately server-side but not exposed to the user.

  Scenario 1: Test successful creation of a BaseEvent object with a valid UUID

  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulCreationOfBaseEvent
    Description: The test is meant to check the successful creation of a BaseEvent object when a valid UUID is provided.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Generate a valid UUID.
    Act: Invoke BaseEvent constructor with the generated UUID.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the BaseEvent object is created successfully and the correlationId is same as the generated UUID.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that a valid UUID results in successful creation of a BaseEvent object. It is crucial in terms of application behavior as the successful creation of the BaseEvent object is dependent on the input UUID.

  Scenario 2: Test unsuccessful creation of a BaseEvent object with a null UUID

  Details:  
    TestName: testUnsuccessfulCreationOfBaseEventWithNullUUID
    Description: The test is meant to check if the creation of a BaseEvent object fails when a null UUID is provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set UUID to null.
    Act: Invoke BaseEvent constructor with null UUID.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if a NullPointerException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that a null UUID results in the failure of the BaseEvent object creation. The test is essential as it makes sure that the method handles null UUIDs properly and prevents potential null pointer exceptions in the application.

  Scenario 3: Test the immutability of correlationId in the BaseEvent class

  Details:  
    TestName: testImmutabilityOfCorrelationId
    Description: The test is meant to check if the correlationId in the created BaseEvent object cannot be modified. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Generate a valid UUID and create a BaseEvent object.
    Act: Attempt to modify the correlationId of the created BaseEvent object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if a compile-time error is obtained.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the correlationId in the BaseEvent class is immutable. Ensuring the immutability of correlationId is important to maintain the consistency and reliability of data across the application.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Leaks/Exposure
Issue: Returning the class's name may expose internals of your application, which could aid an attacker in exploiting other vulnerabilities.
Solution: Avoid exposing information about the internal workings of your application. Depending on the usage, consider overriding the `toString()` method to return less revealing information.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References
Issue: Depending on how the output of `toString()` is used - particularly if it is used to make security decisions - it may result in unauthorized access to internal objects.
Solution: Avoid using class names to make security decisions. If you do need to do so, make sure that you have additional protection in place to prevent unauthorized access.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate the class name is returned

Details:  
  TestName: validateCorrectClassNameReturned
  Description: This test is meant to check if the `toString()` method properly returns the simple class name. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object of class containing this `toString()` method. 
  Act: Invoke the `toString()` method on this object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned class name matches the simple name of the object's class.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the `toString()` method correctly forms the simple class name. This is significant to ensure the `toString()` is accurately representing the class object.

Scenario 2: Validate class name for inherited class

Details:  
  TestName: validateClassNameForInheritedClass
  Description: This test is designed to ascertain if the `toString()` still correctly outputs the class name for an object of a subclass inheriting from the parent class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the subclass inherited from parent class with this `toString()` method. 
  Act: Call the `toString()` method on the subclass object.
  Assert: Compare the returned class name with the simple name of the subclass.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies whether the `toString()` method can accurately return the class name even for subclasses. It's an essential test to ensure the functionality won't break when applied to inherited classes.

Scenario 3: Validate for an anonymous class

Details:  
  TestName: validateForAnonymousClass
  Description: This test is to check if a class that doesn't have a simple name (like an anonymous class) still returns some kind of identifier when `toString()` is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of an anonymous class invoking the method containing `toString()`. 
  Act: Invoke `toString()` on the anonymous class object.
  Assert: Make sure some string is returned, since anonymous classes don't have a simple name.
Validation: 
  This assertion attempts to verify how `toString()` handles classes without simple names. The test is important for ensuring the code can handle edge cases like anonymous classes.

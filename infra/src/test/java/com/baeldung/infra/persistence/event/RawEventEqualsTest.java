================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insufficient Null Checking
Issue: Null checking might appear sufficient but there can be potential NullPointerExceptions that occur. If the properties of the 'other' object are not certain to be non-null, there can be cases leading to NullPointerException.
Solution: Add null checks for each property of the 'other' object before doing the equals comparison, specially before calling methods on objects like 'other.correlationId'.

Vulnerability: Improper Equality Check
Issue: The overall architecture implies possible subclasses. When you check getClass() != obj.getClass() and later cast to RawEvent, you miss equal instances of subclasses.
Solution: Switch to instanceof in the check for class equality. This allows subclasses of RawEvent to be considered equal if their superclass fields match.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test when the method is comparing itself
Details:  
    TestName: testIfComparingSameObject.
    Description: This test will validate if an object returns true when the equals() method compares an object to itself.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an object.
    Act: Invoke equals() method by passing the same object as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result is true. 
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return true when an object is compared with itself because they occupy the same memory location. Hence, they are the same. This test is validatoing the reflexivity property of the equals() method.


Scenario 2: Validate when the method is comparing to null
Details:  
    TestName: testIfComparingWithNull.
    Description: This test will validate if an object returns false when the equals() method compares it with a null object.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an object.
    Act: Invoke equals() method by passing null as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result is false.
  Validation: 
    The equals() should return false when an object is compared with null as per Java's contract of equals method.

    
Scenario 3: Test when objects are from different classes
Details:  
    TestName: testIfComparingObjectsFromDifferentClasses.
    Description: This test validates if equals() method returns false when the object being compared with is from a different type.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate two objects of different types.
    Act: Invoke equals() method by passing the object of a different type.
    Assert: Assert that the result is false.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return false when comparing different types of objects because the states of the objects cannot be effectively compared.

Scenario 4: Comparing two similar objects with the correlationId and payload and transaction time equal
Details:  
    TestName: testComparingTwoEqualRawObjects.
    Description: This test validates if the equals() method returns true when comparing two objects of type RawEvent that have the same correlationId, payload, and transaction time.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Insert the same correlationId, payload, and transaction time in two different objects.
    Act: Invoke equals() method by passing one object to the equals method of the other.
    Assert: Assert that the result is true.
  Validation: 
    Even though they are separate instances, if their correlationId, payload, and transaction time are the same, the equals() method should consider them equal.

Scenario 5: Comparing two similar RawEvent objects with different correlationId
Details:  
    TestName: testComparingTwoEqualRawObjectsWithDifferentCorrelationId.
    Description: This test validates if equals() method returns false when two objects of RawEvent type have different correlationId but same payload and transaction time.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Insert different correlationId but same payload and transaction time in two different objects.
    Act: Invoke equals() method by passing one object to the equals method of the other.
    Assert: Assert that the result is false.
  Validation: 
    The equals() method should consider them not equal because the correlationId is different. This ensures that the equals() method is correctly comparing the field CorrelationId.

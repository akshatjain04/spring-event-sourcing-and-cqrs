ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_5a2657087a

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Potential non-randomness of hashCode() (CWE-330)
Issue: The standard implementation of the hashCode() function using 'prime * result + value.hashCode()' is not cryptographically strong. Although not being a security vulnerability per se, in some specific scenarios this pattern may make the application more predictable, thus easier to attack.
Solution: Use a reliable, good-quality source of randomness or use an encryption hash function like SHA-2 or SHA-3 if the hash code doesnâ€™t need to be constant per runtime session or choose another solid crafting strategy for hash codes.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing hashCode method when correlationId, payload, and transactionTime are null
Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithAllNullValues.
    Description: This test checks the output of the hashCode method when all the fields (correlationId, payload, transactionTime) are null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the target class with all fields set to null.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on this instance.
    Assert: The return value should be 1.
  Validation: 
    Explanation: The method has been specifically coded to return 1 when all fields are null. This test validates that the method is working as expected when all inputs are null.

Scenario 2: Testing hashCode method when correlationId, payload, and transactionTime have non-null values
Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithAllNonNullValues.
    Description: This test checks the output of the hashCode method when all the fields (correlationId, payload, transactionTime) have non-null values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the target class with non-null values for all fields.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on this instance.
    Assert: The return value should be the sum of the hashCode of each field, each multiplied by the prime number 31.
  Validation: 
    Explanation: The method has been specifically coded to calculate the hashcode based on all non-null fields. This test validates that the method is working as expected when all inputs are non-null.

Scenario 3: Testing hashCode method when some fields have null and others have non-null values.
Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithMixOfNullAndNonNull.
    Description: This test checks the output of the hashCode method when some of the fields are null and others are non-null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the target class with some fields set to null and others to non-null.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on this instance.
    Assert: The return value should be the sum of the hashCode of the non-null fields, each multiplied by the prime number 31.
  Validation: 
    Explanation: The method has been specifically coded to calculate the hashCode based on all non-null fields and return 0 for null fields. This test validates that the method is working as expected when inputs are a mix of null and non-null.

Scenario 4: Testing hashCode for two identical objects.
Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeUniqueness.
    Description: This test checks that the hashCode method returns the same hashCode for two identical objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two instances of the target class with identical fields.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both instances.
    Assert: The hashCodes of both objects should be the same.
  Validation: 
    Explanation: The hashCode method is expected to return the same hashCode for two objects with identical data. This test validates this scenario.

Scenario 5: Testing hashCode for two completely different objects.
Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeDifference.
    Description: This test verifies that the hashCode method generates different hashCodes for two objects with completely different data.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two instances of the target class with completely different field values.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both instances.
    Assert: The returned hashCodes should be different.
  Validation: 
    Explanation: The hashCode method is expected to generate unique hashCodes for objects with different data. This test confirms this scenario.

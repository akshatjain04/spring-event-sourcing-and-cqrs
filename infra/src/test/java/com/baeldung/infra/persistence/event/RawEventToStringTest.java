================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The 'toString()' method may expose internal object states, which could aid an attacker in understanding the system or planning further attacks.
Solution: Limit the information revealed through the 'toString()' method or exclude sensitive fields. Always check your code to ensure it contains no debug information before deploying.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The 'id' field seems to be directly exposed without any control. Unauthorized viewing or manipulation of IDs might occur, leading to potential privacy violation or violation of data integrity.
Solution: Consider encapsulating the ID in a getter method and controlling its exposure with appropriate business logic. Remember to follow the principle of least privilege.

"""
Scenario 1: Testing toString method under normal conditions

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringNormalConditions.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method returns the appropriate class' simple name along with the id.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Ensure that the fields of the class like id are properly initialized.
    Act: Invoke the toString method of the class.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes. The expected outcome will be the class' simple name along with the instantiated id.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the toString method works correctly under normal conditions and returns a string representation that employs the class' simple name and id.

Scenario 2: toString method when id is not initialized

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithUninitializedId.
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the toString method when the id field is not initialized.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class without initializing the id field.
    Act: Invoke the toString method of the class.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes. The expected outcome will be the class' simple name followed by a 'null' since the id is not initialized.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the toString method correctly handles the case when the id field is not initialized.

Scenario 3: toString method for a class with complex simple name

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithComplexSimpleName.
  Description: This test is designed to verify the functionality of the toString method when the class has a complex simple name, like inner class or a class with a long name.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an inner class or a class with complex name and initialize the id.
    Act: Invoke the toString method of the class.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes. The expected outcome will be the simple name of the class and id.
  Validation: 
    This assertion validates whether the toString method can correctly process complex class' simple names.

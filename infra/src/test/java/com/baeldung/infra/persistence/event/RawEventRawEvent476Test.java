================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Sensitive Information Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: The 'payload' field might contain sensitive data, which if not handled properly can lead to data exposure.
Solution: Encrypt sensitive data and ensure effective access control mechanisms are in place. Use ORM framework features to handle encryption/decryption.

Vulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (CWE-79)
Issue: If the 'payload' or 'type' fields can be influenced by a user and are used in a web context, this can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
Solution: Sanitize input by escaping special characters or using library functions to cleanse the data.

Vulnerability: Exposed JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) details (CWE-200)
Issue: If any database connection details are written in code or in any configuration files included with this entity, those details could potentially be exposed which may lead to unauthorized database access.
Solution: Hide sensitive details, such as database credentials, using environment variables or secure configuration files that are not committed with the code.

Vulnerability: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring (CWE-778)
Issue: If exceptions and operations of this code are not logged properly, it can make it hard to troubleshoot or identify malicious activities.
Solution: Use robust logging mechanisms to record the application's activities. Implement suitable monitoring systems to timely identify any suspicious activity.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Data Input Test

Details:
  TestName: testRawEventWithValidDataInput
  Description: This test case is aimed at checking the RawEvent method when all parameters are valid. The purpose is to ensure that the RawEvent properly handles and stores valid data.
  
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a UUID, payload, and type as valid inputs.
  Act: Invoke the RawEvent method using valid parameters for correlationId, payload, and type.
  Assert: Compare the actual results (correlationId, payload, and type) against the expected results using assertEquals.
  
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the RawEvent object is correctly initialized with the provided parameters. The significance of this test is to ensure that RawEvent can handle valid data correctly.


Scenario 2: Invalid Data Input Test

Details:
  TestName: testRawEventWithInvalidDataInput
  Description: This test is to check the RawEvent method when one or more parameters are invalid, such as passing null for any of the parameters. The purpose is to ensure the RawEvent correctly handles invalid data.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an invalid UUID, payload or type (such as null).
  Act: Invoke the RawEvent method using the invalid parameters.
  Assert: Use assertThrows to check for an expected exception.
  
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that an exception is thrown when an invalid parameter is given to the RawEvent. This test's significance is to ensure that RawEvent can properly handle and response to invalid data.


Scenario 3: Empty or Nullable Data Test

Details:
  TestName: testRawEventWithEmptyDataInput
  Description: This test is to check the RawEvent method handling of empty or nullable string input. The purpose is to verify that RawEvent correctly handles unexpected but technically valid data.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Create empty or null payload or type.
  Act: Invoke the RawEvent method using the empty or null parameters.
  Assert: Compare the actual results (correlationId, payload, and type) against the expected results using assertEquals.
  
Validation:
  The assertion verifies the RawEvent object correctly handles and stores an empty or null string parameter. This test is significant in ensuring that RawEvent can handle unexpected but technically valid data correctly.


Scenario 4: Boundary Data Testing

Details:
  TestName: testRawEventWithBoundaryDataInput
  Description: This test is to check the RawEvent method handling of boundary cases, such as maximum length of payload string. The purpose is to confirm the robustness of RawEvent under extreme conditions.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Create maximum length of payload string.
  Act: Invoke the RawEvent method using boundary parameters.
  Assert: Use assertDoesNotThrow to check no exception was thrown, or assertEquals to check the outcomes.
  
Validation:
  The assertion verifies the RawEvent correctly handles maximum or minimum input values. The significance of this test is to check how RawEvent behaves under extreme or boundary conditions.

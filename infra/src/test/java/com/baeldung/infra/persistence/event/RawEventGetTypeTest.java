================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Incomplete Code / Lack of Sanitization
Issue: The code provided is incomplete but appears to be handling data access with no evident input validation, which may lead to vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection or Data Tampering.
Solution: Ensure that all user-supplied data is validated/sanitized before being processed. Depending on specific application architecture, use Prepared Statements for SQL And DAO design pattern to abstract and encapsulate all access to the data source.

Vulnerability: Lack of OOP Encapsulation
Issue: Public method 'getType()' may lead to inappropriate property exposure. It directly returns the value of 'type', a private attribute, making data more prone to manipulation.
Solution: Adhere to the principle of 'least privilege' by limiting access to data wherever possible. Consider additional logic in accessor methods where necessary to ensure that 'type' property can only be accessed when it is safe and appropriate to do so.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Type Returned Test
  Details:  
    TestName: testGetTypeReturnsValidType.
    Description: This test checks that the getType method returns the correct type. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the 'type' instance variable with a known value.
    Act: Invoke the getType method.
    Assert: Compare the returned value with the known value set earlier.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies if the returned type is correct. A match between the known value and returned value means a successful execution of the method. This is critical as other operations might be dependent on this method to provide the accurate type.

Scenario 2: Null Type Value Test
  Details:  
    TestName: testGetTypeReturnsNullOnNullSetting.
    Description: This test checks that the getType method return null if 'type' is not set (null).  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Ensure 'type' is null.
    Act: Invoke the getType method.
    Assert: Check if the returned value is null. 
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if getType works correctly when 'type' is not set. The expected behavior in this situation is to get a null return for the method invocation. This is important as it affects how the application handles null 'type' values.

Scenario 3: Empty Type Value Test
  Details:  
    TestName: testGetTypeReturnsEmptyOnEmptySetting.
    Description: This test checks that the getType method returns an empty string if 'type' is set to an empty string. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set 'type' to an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the getType method.
    Assert: Check that the returned value is an empty string. 
  Validation: 
    This assertion checks if getType operates correctly when 'type' is an empty string. The expected response in this circumstance should be an empty string. This is significant in ensuring the program can correctly handle instances where 'type' is an empty string.

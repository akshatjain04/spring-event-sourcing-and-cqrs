================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) - CWE-639
Issue: Setter methods can lead to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR). Using this vulnerability, an attacker can bypass authorization and access resources in the system directly, for example by modifying the 'id'.
Solution: To mitigate IDOR, avoid exposing direct references to internal implementation objects. Use indirect object references, which are not guessable and feasible to bruteforce. If you must use direct references, ensure authorization checks are in place.

Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation - CWE-20
Issue: Not validating inputs can open the door for various potential attacks such as SQL Injection (if the setter value is used in creating a SQL query directly), Cross-Site Scripting (if the setter value is used in UI components directly), etc.
Solution: Perform data validation and sanity checks within setters. Never trust user input, it should always be validated before usage.

Vulnerability: Lack of necessary access modifiers (public, private, protected, and package-private)
Issue: The method setId() is public which means any class from anywhere in the application (or externally) can use this function. This presents a possible attack vector if setId() is used to alter important data.
Solution: Make sure setId() method or similar sensitive methods have restricted access. Consider making them private or protected, or ensuring they're called within a secure context only.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing setId method with Valid Id Value

Details:  
  TestName: setIdWithValidValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setId method is working as expected when provided with a valid id value. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a Long integer for Id. 
    Act: Invoke setId method with this Id.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the Id has been set correctly in the entity.
  Validation: 
    This assertion is aimed at verifying that valid Id values are properly set. If this is the case, it means that the setId method correctly assigns ids to entities, which is essential for identifying unique entities in the system.

Scenario 2: Testing setId method with Null Value

Details:  
  TestName: setIdWithNullValue
  Description: This test is meant to check how the setId method behaves when provided with a null value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a null value for Id. 
    Act: Invoke setId method with this null value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if null value is allowed to be set as an Id.
  Validation: 
    This test validates whether null values are blocked or allowed as Ids by the setId method. This is crucial as setting null Ids might lead to complications in identifying unique entities in the system.

Scenario 3: Testing setId method with Negative Value

Details:  
  TestName: setIdWithNegativeValue
  Description: This test is to check what happens when a negative value is provided to the setId method. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a negative value for Id. 
    Act: Set this negative value as the Id using setId method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the negative Id was allowed or blocked.
  Validation: 
    This test investigates if negative Id values are blocked or permitted by the setId method. Handling negative values correctly is crucial to maintain the logical consistency and integrity of Ids in the system.

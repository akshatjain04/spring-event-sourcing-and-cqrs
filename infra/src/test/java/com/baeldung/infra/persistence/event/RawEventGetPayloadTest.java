================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: N/A
Issue: The code submitted mainly consists of import statements without any logic or function usage. Therefore, no vulnerabilities can be detected from it.
Solution: Provide more context or code that makes use of these imports to offer a realistic assessment of potential vulnerabilities.

"""
Scenario 1: Normal Scenario testing the return of getPayload method

Details:  
  TestName: testGetPayloadReturn.
  Description: This test is designed to check the correctness of the getPayload method, which is meant to return the payload as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with the getPayload method.  
  Act: Call the getPayload method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method returns the actual payload value.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the getPayload method is correctly returning the payload. The expected result is that the getPayload method returns the correct payload. This is significant as it verifies the basic operation of the getPayload method.

Scenario 2: Edge case testing the getPayload method when the payload is empty

Details:
  TestName: testGetPayloadWhenEmpty.
  Description: This test is to check the correctness of the getPayload method when the payload is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with the getPayload method with empty payload
  Act: Call the getPayload method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method returns an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the getPayload method correctly handles the case when the payload is empty. The expected result is that the method returns an empty string. This is significant as it ensures that the getPayload method correctly handles edge cases.

Scenario 3: Error handling testing the getPayload method when the payload is null

Details:
  TestName: testGetPayloadWhenNull.
  Description: This test is to check the getPayload method behavior when the payload is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with the getPayload method with null payload
  Act: Call the getPayload method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method returns null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the getPayload method correctly handles the case when the payload is null. The expected result is that the method returns null. This test is significant as it ensures that the getPayload method can handle null values without breaking.

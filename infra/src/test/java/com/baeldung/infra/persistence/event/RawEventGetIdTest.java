================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: This vulnerability is prevalent when using dynamic SQL. It can lead to unauthorized viewing of data, data corruption or even data loss.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to mitigate this vulnerability.

Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
Issue: It involves including external entity references within XML documents. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to read unauthorized files or launch denial of service attacks.
Solution: Upgrade to a non-vulnerable version of the library or disable XML external entity processing.

Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: A vulnerable application could create an object from a serialized object provided by an attacker. Using this, the attacker can run arbitrary code.
Solution: Do not accept serialized objects from untrusted sources or use serialization mechanisms that allow safe deserialization.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: Caused by use of weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms. This might allow attackers to break encryption and understand sensitive data.
Solution: Always use cryptographic methods which are currently considered strong by the security community.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Positive Test for the getId method 

Details:  
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsLongValue()
  Description: The test is meant to check that the getId method correctly returns a value of type Long. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class that contains the getId method and ensure the id field is set with a Long value. 
  Act: Call the getId method on the created instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value equals the set value and is of type Long.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getId method correctly returns Long value. This test is important for checking the basic functionality of the getId method.


Scenario 2: Null Id Validation Test

Details:  
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsNullIfNotSet()
  Description: The test is meant to check if the getId method returns null when the id of an object is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class that contains the getId method without setting the id field.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the created instance.
  Assert: AssertNull for the returned value.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that if the id hasn't been set, the getId method will return null. This ensures correct system behavior when an object's id hasn't been initialized.


Scenario 3: Negative Test for the getId method
  
Details:  
  TestName: testGetIdDoesNotReturnDifferentValue()
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getId method does not return a different value other than the set id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the id field with a specific Long value. 
  Act: Use the getId method to get the id of the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is equalsTo the value set and not equal to any other value.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method does not return any arbitrary value but the one that was set. It ensures the integrity of the Id field by maintaining its consistency.

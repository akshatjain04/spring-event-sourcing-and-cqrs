================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insufficient Hash Code Collision Management (CWE-327)
Issue: The hash code implementation only considers the 'idOfLead' field. While this reduces the possibility of null point exceptions, it may cause a high level of collisions, where different objects end up with the same hash code. This could potentially lead to performance degradation when working with large data sets in collections.
Solution: Improve the hash function by incorporating more fields of the object into hash code calculation. This will increase the richness of the hash code and reduce the chances of collision. Also, consider using Objects.hashCode(field) method to handle null fields. This will return 0 for null objects and thus, you won't need the manual null check.

"""
  Scenario 1: Check hashCode for null idOfLead

  Details:  
    TestName: checkHashcodeForNullId.
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hashCode method when the idOfLead value is null. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Declare a null idOfLead field.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned hashCode is 1.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method correctly handles null values. This result is expected because the prime number is multiplied by 1 (result) and added to 0 (as idOfLead is null). This test helps confirm that the function handles null inputs correctly, preventing potential NullPointerExceptions.

  
  Scenario 2: Check hashCode for non-null idOfLead

  Details:  
    TestName: checkHashcodeForNonNullId.
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hashCode method when the idOfLead value is a valid UUID. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Declare a valid UUID for the idOfLead field.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned hashCode is not 1.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the hashCode method correctly calculates the hash when idOfLead is not null. The expected result is not 1 - because the idOfLead is not null, it will return a hashCode different from the hashCode for null. This test ensures that hashCode can handle valid UUIDs properly.

  Scenario 3: Consistency of hashCode output 

  Details:  
    TestName: checkConsistencyOfHashcode.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the hashCode for the same idOfLead is consistently the same across multiple calls.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Declare a valid UUID for idOfLead field.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method multiple times.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned hashCode is consistent across multiple invocations.
  Validation: 
    The assertion ensures that the hashCode for a particular idOfLead remains consistent across multiple calls. This is vital for the correct functioning of hashCode in context of hashing objects in hash based collections.

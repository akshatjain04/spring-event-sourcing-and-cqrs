================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: In some instances where random UUIDs are used, the usage of pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) might not be sufficient due to predictable values which could be exploited by an attacker.
Solution: Use secure random number generators where necessary, or consider the nature and sensitivity of the application when deciding what kind of UUID generation technique to use.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: If you are unsure that 'idOfLead' has been initialized before this method is called, there may be a risk of a null pointer exception.
Solution: Ensure that variables are initialized before they are used. Implement appropriate null checks.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If 'idOfLead' contains sensitive information, and if it's used in GET requests or logged somewhere, then it might lead to information exposure.
Solution: Do not pass sensitive information as part of the 'idOfLead'. If it's necessary, use POST requests and/or encrypt the data.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test When idOfLead is Non-Null

Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeForValidIdOfLead
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hashCode method when idOfLead is a valid non-null UUID.
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a valid non-null UUID as the value of idOfLead.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the correct hash computation against the result from the hashCode method.
Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method correctly computes the hash for a given non-null UUID. The expected result is based on the correct hash computation per the standard hashCode contract. This test is significant as it ensures the hashCode method works correctly under normal conditions.


Scenario 2: Test When idOfLead is Null

Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeForNullIdOfLead
    Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the hashCode method when idOfLead is null.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set idOfLead as null.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the expected zero hash against the result from the hashCode method.
Validation:
    This assertion confirms that the hashCode method correctly returns zero when idOfLead is null. This is the expected result based on Java's standard hashCode contract. This test is important as it validates the hash computation under edge-case scenario when idOfLead is null.


Scenario 3: Consistency Test for Same idOfLead

Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeConsistencyForSameIdOfLead
    Description: This test is intended to check that hashCode method is consistent when called multiple times with the same idOfLead.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set a non-null UUID as idOfLead.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method multiple times.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the results from the first invocation of the method with the subsequent ones.
Validation:
    This assertion aims to confirm that the hashCode implementation is consistent as per its contract, meaning that it returns the same result when invoked multiple times on the same object. This test is important as it ensures that the hashCode method meets its contract of maintaining consistency.

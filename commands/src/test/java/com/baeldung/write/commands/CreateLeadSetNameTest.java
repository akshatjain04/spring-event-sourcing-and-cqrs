================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Deserialization CWE-502
Issue: If user-provided input is deserialized, it could be exploited to execute arbitrary code during the deserialization process.
Solution: Avoid deserialization of untrusted data. If that cannot be avoided, make sure to use a safe replacement for Java's native deserialization or use libraries that allow for secure deserialization like 'owasp-java-encoder'. Also use a code scanner to find any potential insecure deserialization within the software.

"""
  Scenario 1: Testing setName() with a non-null String input.
  
  Details:  
    TestName: setNameWithNonNullString.
    Description: This test is designed to assess the setName() method's functionality when it is provided with a non-null String as input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a non-null String value that is to be used as a test input.
    Act: Invoke setName() method using the non-null String as an argument.
    Assert: Assert that the 'name' field of the object is set to the input value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly assigns the 'name' field of the object to the non-null String input value.
    This test is vital as it verifies the expected behavior of assigning a value to the 'name' field in common use cases.

  Scenario 2: Testing setName() with a null String input.
  
  Details:  
    TestName: setNameWithNullString.
    Description: This test is designed to evaluate the setName() method's behavior when it is provided with a null String as input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a null String value that is to be used as a test input.
    Act: Invoke setName() method using the null String as an argument.
    Assert: Assert that the 'name' field of the object is set to null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion confirms that the method correctly assigns the 'name' field of the object to null when a null String is the input.
    This test is important as it evaluates the method's behavior with null inputs, which can cause potential null pointer exceptions.

  Scenario 3: Testing setName() called multiple times on the same object.
    
  Details:  
    TestName: setNameMultipleTimes.
    Description: This test is designed to assess whether successive calls to setName() affect the 'name' field properly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create multiple non-null String values that are to be used as test inputs.
    Act: Invoke setName() method multiple times using the different strings as argument each time.
    Assert: Assert that the 'name' field of the object is set to the value provided in the latest setName() call.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms that the method correctly assigns the 'name' field to the value provided in the latest invocation, even after multiple calls.
    This test is significant as it verifies the expected behavior of the setName() method when called several times on the same object.
  
  Scenario 4: Testing setName() with an empty String input.
  
  Details:  
    TestName: setNameWithEmptyString.
    Description: This test is designed to assess the setName() method's functionality when it is provided with an empty String as an input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty String value that is to be used as a test input.
    Act: Invoke setName() method using the empty String as an argument.
    Assert: Assert that the 'name' field of the object is set to the empty String.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly assigns the 'name' field of the object to the empty String input value.
    This test assures that the setName() method handles scenarios where an empty String is passed as input, which is a valid edge case.

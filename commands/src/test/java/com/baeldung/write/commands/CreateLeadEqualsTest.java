================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unsafe Object Comparison (CWE-595)
Issue: In Java equals() method, `getClass() != obj.getClass()` is used, and this may lead to various type-related security issues as it does not support subclassing.
Solution: Use instanceof to check if the passed object is of the correct type, then cast it accordingly. This allows for subclasses to be included in the check and is not susceptible to ClassCastException.

Vulnerability: Null Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)
Issue: The object `name` is dereferenced without a prior null check, leading to potential NullPointerExceptions.
Solution: Ensure object is checked for null before being dereferenced to avoid NullPointerExceptions. Use java.util.Objects.equals() utility method for null-safe comparison.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (CWE-639)
Issue: Directly comparing sensitive data objects could expose those objects to tampering or unauthorized read access.
Solution: Avoid exposing sensitive data to the Equals method. If needed, protect these methods with correct access modifiers and encapsulated in other classes.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing Object Equality 

Details:  
  TestName: testObjectEquality.
  Description: This scenario is meant to test if the two objects are the exact same instance. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two references to the same object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, using one reference as the parameter to the other. 
  Assert: Assert that the returned boolean is true.
Validation: 
  As we're dealing with the same instance, the equals method should return true. This scenario validates the identity comparison logic in the equals implementation.

Scenario 2: Testing Null object 

Details:  
  TestName: testNullObject.
  Description: This scenario is meant to test the case where the object argument to the equals method is null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid instance of CreateLead.
  Act: Invoke the equals method using null as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the returned boolean is false.
Validation: 
  It verifies the null object checking logic in the equals method. A null object should not be considered equal to any valid object.

Scenario 3: Testing Different Classes 

Details:  
  TestName: testDifferentClasses.
  Description: This scenario is meant to test the condition where the classes of the two instances are different. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of CreateLead and another instance from different class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method using the instance of the different class as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the returned boolean is false.
Validation: 
  It verifies if equals method is accurately comparing classes of objects. Objects from two different classes cannot be equal.

Scenario 4: Testing Field Equality 

Details:
  TestName: testFieldEquality.
  Description: This scenario is meant to test the comparison of the "name" field in the CreateLead instance. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of CreateLead with identical "name" fields.
  Act: Invoke the equals method using one instance as the parameter to the other.
  Assert: Assert that the returned boolean is true.
Validation:
  It verifies if the equals method is correctly comparing the "name" field of the objects. They should be considered equal if their respective "name" fields are identical.

Scenario 5: Testing Field Inequality 

Details:
  TestName: testFieldInequality.
  Description: This scenario tests the case where the "name" field value in the two instances are different. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of CreateLead with differing "name" fields.
  Act: Invoke the equals method using one instance as the parameter to the other.
  Assert: Assert that the returned boolean is false.
Validation:
  It confirms the field comparison logic in the equals method. If the respective "name" fields in the two instances are different, they should not be considered equal.

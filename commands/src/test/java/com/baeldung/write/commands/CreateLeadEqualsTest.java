================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Missing Input Validation
Issue: The function is comparing the 'name' attribute without previously checking if it is a valid input.
Solution: Always perform input validation. Consider the use of 'java.util.Objects.equals()' for the null-safe equality evaluation. The utility automatically handles null inputs.

Vulnerability: Not using @Override Annotation
Issue: This provided equals method seems to override the equals method from the Object class. If so, it should have the @Override annotation. If the method signature is accidentally changed or is not correctly overriding equals method from Object class, the compiler won't alert you the issue.
Solution: Start by adding the @Override annotation: '@Override public boolean equals(final Object obj){...}' to make it clear that it should override the equals method from the object class and to get compiler assistance.

Vulnerability: Non-consistent equals() and hashCode()
Issue: There is a contract between equals() and hashCode() that if two objects are equal then they must have the same hashCode(). If they do not, this can lead to unexpected issues, especially when used in collections such as HashSet, HashMap etc.
Solution: Make sure to override hashCode() when equals() is overridden and ensure the contract is adhered to.

Vulnerability: Instanceof instead of getClass()
Issue: The code uses 'getClass() != obj.getClass()' to check the product type. This could be problematic with subclasses and may not be intended. This could lead to potential ClassCastException.
Solution: If your intention is to not allow subclasses, then this is fine. If you want to allow them, consider using 'instanceof' keyword instead.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Testing when both objects are the same.
  
Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameObjects.
  Description: This test aims to check the behavior when both objects are identical. It ensures that the equals method returns true when provided with a reference to itself.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Declare a CreateLead object and initialize its name field.
    Act: Pass the object as an argument to the equals method.
    Assert: The result should be true.
  Validation: 
    As we are comparing an object to itself, the equals method should return true. This validates that identical object comparison functions correctly.

Scenario 2: Comparing an object with null.

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNullObject.
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when a null object is passed as an argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Declare a CreateLead object and initialize its name field.
    Act: Pass a null reference to the equals method.
    Assert: The result should be false.
  Validation:
    Passing a null object to the equals method should return false. This confirms that null object comparison is handled properly.

Scenario 3: Comparing objects of different classes.

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClassObject.
  Description: This test is to confirm that the equals method returns false when we compare a CreateLead object with an object of a different class.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Declare a CreateLead object and another object of any different class.
    Act: Pass the object of the different class to the equals method of the CreateLead object.
    Assert: The result should be false.
  Validation:
    Comparing a CreateLead object with an object of different class should return false as they can't be equivalent. This further validates the equals implementation correctness.

Scenario 4: Comparing CreateLead objects with different names.

Details: 
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentCreateLeadNames.
  Description: This test validates the equals method when two CreateLead objects with different 'name' fields are compared.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: Declare two CreateLead objects with different names.
    Act: Pass one object to the equals method of the other.
    Assert: The result should be false.
  Validation:
    As we are comparing two different CreateLead objects (with different 'name' fields), the equals method should mark them different and return false. This verifies name integrity within the equals method.

Scenario 5: Comparing CreateLead objects with the same names.

Details: 
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameCreateLeadNames.
  Description: This test is to verify the equals method's correct functioning when the 'name' fields of two CreateLead objects are identical. 
  Execution: 
    Arrange: Declare two CreateLead objects with the same name.
    Act: Pass one object to the equals method of the other.
    Assert: The result should be true.
  Validation: 
    As the 'name' fields of both CreateLead objects are identical, the equals method should return true. This ensures name equality considerations within the equals method.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The equals method does not validate the type of the input object properly before casting it to CreateLead, which can result in a ClassCastException if the object is not of the CreateLead type.
Solution: Before casting, use the instanceof operator to check if 'obj' is an instance of CreateLead.

Vulnerability: Insecure Object Equality Implementation
Issue: The equals method uses reference equality to compare the 'name' field, which can lead to unexpected behavior if 'name' is not a primitive or an immutable object.
Solution: Ensure that the 'name' field is compared using a secure method such as 'Objects.equals()' to handle nulls and provide value equality.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful equality check with the same object instance

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithSameInstance
  Description: This test checks if the `equals` method correctly identifies that two references pointing to the same object instance are equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the `CreateLead` class and assign it to two different references.
  Act: Call the `equals` method using one reference and pass the other reference as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the `equals` method is true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that when two references point to the same object, the `equals` method should recognize them as equal. This is significant because it ensures that the method adheres to the reflexive property of equality, which is crucial for correct behavior in collections and other parts of the system that rely on object equality.

Scenario 2: Equality check with null

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithNull
  Description: This test verifies that the `equals` method returns false when comparing a `CreateLead` object with null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the `CreateLead` class.
  Act: Call the `equals` method with null as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the `equals` method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method correctly handles null comparisons, which is important to prevent `NullPointerException` and ensure the method is robust.

Scenario 3: Equality check with different class type

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentClassType
  Description: This test ensures that the `equals` method returns false when comparing a `CreateLead` object with an instance of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the `CreateLead` class and an instance of a different class (e.g., `Object` or any other class that is not a subclass of `CreateLead`).
  Act: Call the `equals` method with the instance of the different class as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the `equals` method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the `equals` method only considers objects of the same class to be potentially equal. This is important for maintaining type safety and logical correctness.

Scenario 4: Equality check with same class but different attribute values

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentAttributeValues
  Description: This test checks if the `equals` method returns false when comparing two `CreateLead` objects with different `name` attribute values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the `CreateLead` class with different `name` attribute values.
  Act: Call the `equals` method on one instance, passing the other instance as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the `equals` method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the `equals` method is sensitive to differences in attribute values. This is significant for correct identification of object uniqueness based on their attributes.

Scenario 5: Equality check with same class and same attribute values

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithSameAttributeValues
  Description: This test verifies that the `equals` method returns true when comparing two `CreateLead` objects with the same `name` attribute values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the `CreateLead` class with identical `name` attribute values.
  Act: Call the `equals` method on one instance, passing the other instance as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the `equals` method is true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the `equals` method correctly identifies objects with identical attribute values as equal. This is crucial for the method's consistency and for the correct functioning of data structures that depend on equality, such as sets and maps.

Scenario 6: Equality check with one object having a null attribute value

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithNullAttributeValue
  Description: This test ensures that the `equals` method returns false when comparing a `CreateLead` object with a `name` attribute set to null with another `CreateLead` object with a non-null `name`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create one instance of the `CreateLead` class with a `name` attribute set to null and another instance with a `name` attribute set to a non-null value.
  Act: Call the `equals` method on the instance with the null `name`, passing the instance with the non-null `name` as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the `equals` method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the `equals` method handles null attribute values correctly, which is important to avoid false positives in equality checks and to maintain the integrity of the method's contract.

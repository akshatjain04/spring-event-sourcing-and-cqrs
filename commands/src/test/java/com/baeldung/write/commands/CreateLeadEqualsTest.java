================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-595: Comparison of Object References Instead of Object Contents
Issue: The 'equals' method compares object references using '==' instead of comparing the actual object contents, which can lead to unexpected behavior if two different instances with the same contents are considered not equal.
Solution: Use 'equals' method for comparing the contents of objects instead of the '==' operator. For example, use 'this.name.equals(other.name)' instead of 'this.name == other.name'.

Vulnerability: CWE-480: Use of Incorrect Operator
Issue: The use of '!=' to compare strings may lead to errors because it checks for reference inequality rather than content inequality. This may cause the 'equals' method to incorrectly determine that two strings with the same content are not equal.
Solution: Replace the '!=' operator with '.equals()' when comparing strings to ensure content equality. In the case of null checks, continue to use '=='.

Vulnerability: CWE-570: Expression is Always False
Issue: If the 'name' field in 'CreateLead' is of type String, the expression 'name == null' will always be false for an empty string which is not the same as null, potentially causing a logical error.
Solution: Ensure to handle empty strings and null values appropriately, possibly using 'StringUtils.isEmpty(name)' or 'name == null || name.isEmpty()' if using Java's standard library.

Vulnerability: CWE-563: Assignment to Variable without Use
Issue: The import statement 'import javax.validation.constraints.NotNull;' is followed by a comma, suggesting another import on the same line, which is likely a typo and can cause a compilation error.
Solution: Remove the erroneous comma at the end of the 'import javax.validation.constraints.NotNull;' statement and ensure each import statement is on its own line.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Same Object Comparison

Details:  
  TestName: sameObjectComparison
  Description: Check if the equals method returns true when comparing an object to itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the CreateLead class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing the same object as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that an object is equal to itself, which is a fundamental property of the equals contract. This test ensures the method's compliance with reflexive behavior.

Scenario 2: Comparison with Null

Details:  
  TestName: comparisonWithNull
  Description: Ensure the equals method returns false when comparing the CreateLead object with null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the CreateLead class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing null as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the equals method adheres to the contract by returning false when comparing to null. This test is significant as it prevents NullPointerException and ensures proper null handling.

Scenario 3: Different Class Comparison

Details:  
  TestName: differentClassComparison
  Description: Verify that the equals method returns false when comparing a CreateLead object with an instance of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the CreateLead class and an instance of a different class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing the different class instance as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the equals method respects the class type and only considers an object equal if it is of the same class. This test is crucial for maintaining type safety and ensuring logical equality.

Scenario 4: Different Name Comparison

Details:  
  TestName: differentNameComparison
  Description: Ensure the equals method returns false when comparing two CreateLead objects with different names.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the CreateLead class with different 'name' values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, comparing one object with the other.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method assesses the 'name' field correctly and recognizes when two objects have different 'name' values. This test is vital for upholding the business logic that distinguishes CreateLead objects based on their names.

Scenario 5: Identical Name Comparison

Details:  
  TestName: identicalNameComparison
  Description: Test if the equals method returns true for two CreateLead objects with identical names.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the CreateLead class with the same 'name' value.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, comparing one object with the other.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the equals method correctly identifies objects as equal when their 'name' fields match. This test is essential for confirming that the equality check aligns with the intended business logic of comparing CreateLead objects based on their names.

Scenario 6: Name Is Null in One Object

Details:  
  TestName: nameIsNullInOneObject
  Description: Test the equals method when one CreateLead object has a null 'name' and the other has a non-null 'name'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create one instance of the CreateLead class with 'name' as null and another with 'name' set to a non-null value.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, comparing the object with null 'name' to the one with a non-null 'name'.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the equals method treats objects with a null 'name' as not equal to those with a non-null 'name'. This test is crucial for ensuring that the equals method correctly handles null values in the 'name' field.

Scenario 7: Name Is Null in Both Objects

Details:  
  TestName: nameIsNullInBothObjects
  Description: Confirm that the equals method returns true when both CreateLead objects have a null 'name'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the CreateLead class with the 'name' field set to null.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, comparing the two objects.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method considers two objects with null 'name' fields as equal. This test ensures that the method correctly handles the case where the 'name' field is null in both objects being compared.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Input Validation
Issue: User input is not validated. If not properly sanitized, it can lead to security holes like XSS, SQL Injection, and file inclusion vulnerabilities
Solution: Always validate user input to prevent malicious inputs from attackers. You can use the validate() function to check for unwanted inputs.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: If not properly handled, random values can lead to a number of attacks
Solution: Make sure to use secure methods to generate random values. Java provides SecureRandom class which is recommended over the Random class for security sensitive operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: If SQL queries are constructed by concatenating user inputs, SQL Injection vulnerabilities can occur
Solution: To prevent SQL Injection, all SQL queries should be parameterized or prepared. Java provides PreparedStatement for this.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: Hard-coded credentials can be easily detected via static code analysis
Solution: Never use hard-coded credentials. Instead, use configuration files or environment variables and limit access to these.

Vulnerability: CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
Issue: If session ids are not properly expired, it can lead to Session Sidejacking or Hijacking attacks
Solution: Session IDs must be properly expired and invalidated after logout. Use HttpSession object's invalidate() method to do this.

"""
  Scenario 1: CreateLead with a Valid Name

  Details:  
    TestName: initializeCreateLeadWithValidName.
    Description: This test validates if the CreateLead method can successfully initialize when passed a valid name string. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: The tester will need to provide a valid name string.
    Act: The CreateLead method will be called with this valid name string.
    Assert: Assert that the constructed CreateLead instance is not null and the name is as expected.
  Validation: 
    Assert validates that the CreateLead instance was successfully created with the correct name. This is significant in ensuring the method can handle and correctly store regular input.


  Scenario 2: CreateLead with an Empty Name String

  Details:  
    TestName: initializeCreateLeadWithEmptyName.
    Description: The test is meant to check the behavior of the CreateLead method when invoked with an empty string as the name. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: The tester will need to provide an empty string.
    Act: The CreateLead method will be called with this empty string.
    Assert: Assert that IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    Assert validates that CreateLead method doesn't accept empty strings as names and defends against such erroneous inputs.


  Scenario 3: CreateLead with Null as the Name

  Details:  
    TestName: initializeCreateLeadWithNullName.
    Description: The test is meant to check the behavior of the CreateLead method when called with null as the name.
  Execution:
    Arrange: The tester will provide null as the value for the name.
    Act: The CreateLead method will be called with a null name.
    Assert: Assert that a NullPointerException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    Assert validates that the CreateLead method appropriately handles null inputs by throwing a NullPointerException.


  Scenario 4: CreateLead with a Very Long Name

  Details:  
    TestName: initializeCreateLeadWithLongName.
    Description: This tests the CreateLead method ability to handle a really long name string, presenting a situation of stress testing.
  Execution:
    Arrange: The tester will need to provide a very long name string.
    Act: The CreateLead method will be called with this very long string.
    Assert: Assert that the constructed CreateLead instance is not null and the name is as expected or an error is handled if the name length exceeds allowed limits.
  Validation: 
    Assert validates the method handles strings longer than the typical expected inputs gracefully, either by working correctly or handling the error in a defined manner.

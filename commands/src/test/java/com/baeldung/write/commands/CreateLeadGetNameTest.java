Scenario 1: Test getName returns valid name

Details:  
  TestName: testGetNameReturnsValidName
  Description: This test checks whether the getName method returns a non-null, non-empty string as expected when the name property has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the object with a valid name string.
  Act: Call the getName method on the object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned name matches the expected name set during arrangement.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that getName correctly retrieves the name of the object. This test is significant because it validates the basic retrieval functionality of the getName method, ensuring that it provides the correct output when the internal state is properly set.

Scenario 2: Test getName with uninitialized name

Details:  
  TestName: testGetNameWithUninitializedName
  Description: This test ensures that the getName method returns null or a default value if the name property has not been initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the name property.
  Act: Call the getName method on the object.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is null or a predefined default value.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates that the getName method handles uninitialized name properties correctly. This is important for ensuring that the method behaves as expected in scenarios where the name has not yet been set, which could be a common case in the application's lifecycle.

Scenario 3: Test getName after setting name to empty string

Details:  
  TestName: testGetNameAfterSettingNameToEmptyString
  Description: This test checks if the getName method can return an empty string when the name property is explicitly set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the name property of the object to an empty string.
  Act: Call the getName method on the object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation: 
  This assertion checks that the getName method does not modify the name value and returns it as is, even if it is an empty string. This test is important to ensure that the method accurately reflects the state of the name property, including when it is intentionally set to an empty value.

Scenario 4: Test getName is thread-safe

Details:  
  TestName: testGetNameIsThreadSafe
  Description: This test verifies that concurrent calls to getName return consistent results, indicating that the method is thread-safe.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the name property of the object to a valid string. Create multiple threads that will call the getName method.
  Act: Start all threads and have them call the getName method.
  Assert: Check that all threads receive the same name value as set initially.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the getName method can be safely called by multiple threads without causing inconsistent results. This is crucial for the method's reliability in a multi-threaded environment and ensures that the state of the object is not corrupted by concurrent access.

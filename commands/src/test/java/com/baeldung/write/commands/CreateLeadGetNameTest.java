================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: Debugging code can create an unintended entry point in an application, making it easier for malicious users to exploit a system.
Solution: To avoid such vulnerabilities, always double-check that debugging code has been removed or disabled before deploying a product.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: If a user is able to submit SQL through the user interface, and the backend code simply appends the input into a SQL statement, it could lead to SQL injection and therefore unauthorized access.
Solution: To prevent SQL injection, any variable used in a SQL statement should be properly sanitized and parameterized.

Scenario 1: Test to validate getName method returns correct name.

Details:
  TestName: testGetNameReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is intended to check whether the getName() method is working correctly and returns the correct name. We will compare the returned name to the expected name to verify this.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary for this test since getName() does not require any parameters nor does it involve any computations.
  Act: Call the getName() method.
  Assert: Check if the returned name is equal to the expected name.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to check if the getName() method is functioning properly. The expected result is based on the fact that the getName() method should return the exact name it was supposed to return. This is a fundamental test to ensure the basic functionality of the getName() method.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getName method returns null when the name is not set.
  
Details:  
  TestName: testGetNameReturnsNullWhenNotSet.
  Description: This test aims to assess the scenario when getName() is called before the name is set. The expected result in such a case should be null.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Ensure the name is not set or initialized.
  Act: Invoke the getName() method.
  Assert: Validate that null is returned.
Validation: 
  The assertion would verify if null is returned when getName() is invoked without setting the name. The reason for the expected result is that Java initializes class-type variables to null by default. Therefore, if the name is not explicitly set, getName() should return null. This is an important test for error-handling and uninitialized state handling.

Scenario 3: Test to validate getName method returns an empty string when the name is set to an empty string.
   
Details:  
    TestName: testGetNameReturnsEmptyString.
    Description: This test is intended to assess the behavior of the getName() method when the name is an empty string. The expectation here is that the method should return an empty string.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set name to a predefined empty string.
    Act: Invoke the getName() method.
    Assert: Validate that an empty string is returned.
Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that an empty string is returned when the name is explicitly set to an empty string. This is expected because getName() should return the exact value of the name, which is an empty string in this scenario. This test is important in validating the application's behavior towards empty input.

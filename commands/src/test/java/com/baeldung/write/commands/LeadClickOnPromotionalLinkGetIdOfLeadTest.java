ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getIdOfLead_aeb9b47e90

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-285: Improper Authorization
Issue: If the getIdOfLead method is allowed uncontrolled access, it could lead to unauthorized access and potential exposure of sensitive data.
Solution: Ensure your implementation validates requests before providing access to this method. You should only expose necessary methods and always use appropriate access modifiers.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid non-null UUID
Details:  
    TestName: testGetIdOfLeadForNonNullUuid
    Description: This test checks if the getIdOfLead method returns a valid non-null UUID of the lead. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: We ensure that the `idOfLead` variable is initialized with a non-null UUID.
    Act: Invoke the getIdOfLead method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit to check that the returned UUID is equal to the initial UUID and is not null.
  Validation: 
    The UUID returned by getIdOfLead should be the same as the `idOfLead`. Hence, this test verifies that the correct UUID is returned and assures that the getIdOfLead method is functioning correctly in regular conditions.


Scenario 2: Null UUID 
Details:  
    TestName: testGetIdOfLeadForNullUuid
    Description: This test checks if the getIdOfLead method returns null when `idOfLead` is not initialized. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: We ensure that the `idOfLead` variable is null or not initialized.
    Act: Invoke the getIdOfLead method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit to check that the returned UUID is null.
  Validation: 
    Since the `idOfLead` is not initialized, the getIdOfLead method should return null. This test verifies this behavior and confirms the getIdOfLead method's functionality under these conditions.


Scenario 3: Persistent UUID across multiple method calls
Details:  
    TestName: testPersistentUuidAcrossMultipleMethodCalls
    Description: This test checks if multiple calls to the getIdOfLead method return the same UUID.
  Execution:
    Arrange: We ensure that the `idOfLead` variable is initialized with a UUID.
    Act: Invoke the getIdOfLead method multiple times.
    Assert: Use JUnit to confirm that the returned value remained constant across the calls.
  Validation: 
    Since the UUID is an identifier, it is not expected to change across calls unless explicitly set to a new value. This test will verify if the getIdOfLead method maintains this persistent behaviour.
    

Scenario 4: Uniqueness of UUID across different instances
Details:  
    TestName: testUniquenessOfUuidAcrossInstances
    Description: This test checks if different instances of the class return different UUIDs.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create several instances of the class and initialize their `idOfLead` with a unique UUID.
    Act: Invoke the getIdOfLead method on each instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit to ensure that every instance returns a different UUID.
  Validation: 
    As UUID should be unique for each instance, this test proves the uniqueness of the getIdOfLead method and the correct set up of the `idOfLead` in each instance.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Access Control Flaw
Issue: Public methods allowing unrestricted access to sensitive data can contribute towards an access control flaw.
Solution: Consider implementing access control methods, or limiting unnecessary access to sensitive data. Make use of Java's built-in access modifiers appropriately.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: Return methods that expose sensitive identifiers (like idOfLead in this case) can be exploited for IDOR attacks.
Solution: Avoid directly exposing internal identifiers to untrusted interfaces. Usage of authorization checks, randomizing ids, or UUIDs can mitigate this.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Effective Retrieval of Lead ID

Details:  
  TestName: testEffectiveRetrievalOfLeadId.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method getIdOfLead() returns a non-null UUID representing the lead's ID, which implies that the lead ID can be retrieved accurately from the system. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the class containing said method (omitted due to lack of context). Also determine a UUID to represent the lead ID.
  Act: Invoke the method getIdOfLead() without any parameters.
  Assert: AssertNotNull on the obtained UUID from getIdOfLead(). 
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the UUID retrieved is not null. As the lead ID is crucial for tracking, it should typically exist in the system and its successful retrieval is vital.

Scenario 2: ID type Compatibility Test

Details:  
  TestName: testIdTypeCompatibility.
  Description: This test verifies that the ID returned by getIdOfLead() is indeed of the UUID datatype. A lead ID is conventionally represented as a UUID, hence, this compatibility check is crucial.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the class which contains said method (omitted due to lack of context). Also determine a UUID to represent the lead ID.
  Act: Invoke the method getIdOfLead().
  Assert: AssertTrue that the obtained object from getIdOfLead() is an instance of UUID.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the data type of the lead ID is UUID. This test assures that the method getIdOfLead() is operating correctly and returning an ID of the expected type. 

Scenario 3: Check for Lead ID Consistency

Details:  
  TestName: testIdConsistency.
  Description: This test verifies that the retrieved ID remains consistent across repeated calls, meaning the ID of a given lead does not change unexpectedly. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the class which has said method (omitted due to lack of context). Also set a UUID to represent the lead ID.
  Act: Invoke the method getIdOfLead() twice.
  Assert: AssertEquals on both the UUIDs obtained from the two calls.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify consistency in the lead ID across multiple calls. To maintain coherence in the tracking system, the UUID for a lead should remain constant."

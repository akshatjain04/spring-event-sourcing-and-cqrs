================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-486: Comparison of Classes by Name
Issue: Comparing objects using getClass() may lead to issues if subclasses are expected to be equal. When the code is used in a context where subclasses with the same state should be considered equal, using getClass() for equality check can lead to incorrect results.
Solution: Consider using instanceof instead of getClass() to allow instances of subclasses to be considered equal if they have the same state. Alternatively, document the behavior clearly if the current behavior is intentional.

Vulnerability: CWE-595: Comparison of Object References Instead of Object Contents
Issue: Using == to compare object references can result in unexpected behavior when comparing strings or other objects that can have the same value but different references. This issue can lead to logical errors in the application's flow.
Solution: Use .equals() method for object comparison instead of == to compare the contents of objects for equality.

Vulnerability: CWE-480: Use of Incorrect Operator
Issue: The use of == to compare idOfLead, which might be a String or another object type, checks for reference equality rather than object content equality. This can lead to a scenario where two logically equivalent objects are not considered equal because they do not refer to the exact same object instance.
Solution: Always use .equals() for comparing objects to ensure content equality. If idOfLead is a String or similar object, this is crucial for correct behavior.

Vulnerability: CWE-570: Expression is Always False
Issue: The condition 'other.idOfLead != null' is always true when 'idOfLead == null' is false. This is because both conditions cannot be true at the same time. This redundant check may indicate a misunderstanding of the logic and could potentially hide other logical errors.
Solution: Refactor the conditional logic to accurately reflect the intended equality check without redundant or unreachable code paths.

Vulnerability: CWE-563: Assignment to Variable without Use ('Unused Variable')
Issue: The import statement 'import com.baeldung.infra.command.Command;' is declared but not used within the provided code. Unused imports can clutter the codebase, leading to confusion and potential name conflicts.
Solution: Remove unused import statements to improve code clarity and maintainability.

Vulnerability: Syntax Error: Invalid Import Statement
Issue: The import statement for UUID is terminated with a semicolon and immediately followed by another import statement without a line break, which is not a valid syntax in Java.
Solution: Correct the import statements so that each is on its own line with a proper semicolon termination. For example, use 'import java.util.UUID;' on one line and 'import com.baeldung.infra.command.Command;' on another.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Equality Check for Identical Objects

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityForIdenticalObjects
  Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns true when the same object instance is passed as the parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the LeadClickOnPromotionalLink class and assign it to a reference variable.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with the same instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that an object is equal to itself. This test is significant as it validates the reflexive property of the equals contract.

Scenario 2: Equality Check with Null

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithNull
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when null is passed as the parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the LeadClickOnPromotionalLink class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with null as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly handles null input. This test is important to confirm that the method safeguards against null pointer exceptions and adheres to the equals contract.

Scenario 3: Equality Check with Different Class Objects

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: This test checks that the equals method returns false when an object of a different class is passed as the parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the LeadClickOnPromotionalLink class and an instance of a different class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with the instance of the different class as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method can correctly determine when objects of different classes are not equal. This test is crucial to ensure type safety and proper functioning of the equals method.

Scenario 4: Equality Check with Different ID Values

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithDifferentIdValues
  Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns false when two LeadClickOnPromotionalLink objects have different idOfLead values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the LeadClickOnPromotionalLink class with different idOfLead values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with one instance as the parameter to the other instance's equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  This assertion checks that the equals method properly evaluates the idOfLead field for equality. This test is important to ensure that objects with different identities are not considered equal, which is a core aspect of the equals contract.

Scenario 5: Equality Check with Same ID Values

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithSameIdValues
  Description: This test confirms that the equals method returns true when two LeadClickOnPromotionalLink objects have the same non-null idOfLead value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the LeadClickOnPromotionalLink class with the same non-null idOfLead value.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with one instance as the parameter to the other instance's equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly determines equality based on the idOfLead field when its value is not null. This test is significant as it confirms the method's ability to recognize equivalent object identities, aligning with the equals contract.

Scenario 6: Equality Check with Both IDs Null

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithBothIdsNull
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns true when both LeadClickOnPromotionalLink objects have a null idOfLead value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the LeadClickOnPromotionalLink class, both with a null idOfLead value.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on one instance with the other instance as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the equals method treats two objects with null idOfLead values as equal. This test is important to verify that the method correctly handles null values according to the equals contract.

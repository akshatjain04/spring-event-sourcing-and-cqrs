================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-470: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')
Issue: Unsafe casting based on getClass() without validation can lead to unauthorized object instantiation if the input is controlled by an attacker.
Solution: Validate and sanitize input before casting. Use a whitelist of allowed classes or check against a secure list of expected classes.

Vulnerability: CWE-595: Comparison of Object References Instead of Object Contents
Issue: Using '==' to compare object references might lead to incorrect comparisons when the intent is to compare the contents.
Solution: Use the .equals() method for object content comparison instead of '==' to prevent logical errors.

Vulnerability: CWE-480: Use of Incorrect Operator
Issue: Potential confusion in using '!=' for null check might lead to logical errors, especially if the code is modified without proper understanding.
Solution: Use the .equals() method to check for content equality or '== null' for null checks to improve code clarity and maintainability.

Vulnerability: CWE-690: Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: Dereferencing a null pointer without checking the return value can cause a NullPointerException.
Solution: Always check for null before dereferencing an object to prevent NullPointerException.

Vulnerability: CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Issue: If 'idOfLead' contains sensitive information, the equals method may inadvertently expose it through logging or error messages.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive information is not exposed through comparison methods, and use masking or tokenization if necessary.

Vulnerability: CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
Issue: If the 'idOfLead' is used as a key in a HashMap and is not immutable or does not have a proper hashCode implementation, it may lead to hash collisions and performance issues.
Solution: Ensure that objects used as keys in hash-based collections are immutable and have a proper hashCode implementation.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful equality check on the same instance

Details:  
  TestName: equalsWithSameInstance
  Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns true when comparing an object to itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink with a specific UUID for idOfLead.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing the same instance as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns true.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the equals method correctly identifies that an object is equal to itself, which is fundamental to the equals contract. This test is significant as it validates the reflexive property of the equals method.

Scenario 2: Equality check with null

Details:  
  TestName: equalsWithNull
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when comparing the LeadClickOnPromotionalLink object to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink with a specific UUID for idOfLead.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with null as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the equals method adheres to the contract by returning false when the provided object is null. This is important to prevent NullPointerException and maintain the equals method's contract.

Scenario 3: Equality check with a different class object

Details:  
  TestName: equalsWithDifferentClass
  Description: This test checks that the equals method returns false when comparing a LeadClickOnPromotionalLink object to an object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink and an instance of a different class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing the different class instance as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the equals method can distinguish between objects of different classes, which is essential for type-specific equality checks. This test is significant for maintaining type safety in equality comparisons.

Scenario 4: Equality check with a different LeadClickOnPromotionalLink object with null idOfLead

Details:  
  TestName: equalsWithDifferentObjectNullId
  Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns false when comparing two LeadClickOnPromotionalLink objects where one object has a null idOfLead and the other has a non-null idOfLead.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink, one with a null idOfLead and the other with a specific UUID for idOfLead.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, comparing the two objects.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the equals method correctly handles cases where the idOfLead field is null in one object and not null in another, which is crucial for accurate object comparison. This test is important for ensuring that the equals method can handle null field values properly.

Scenario 5: Equality check with two different LeadClickOnPromotionalLink objects with different idOfLead values

Details:  
  TestName: equalsWithDifferentIdValues
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when comparing two LeadClickOnPromotionalLink objects with different idOfLead values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink, each with a unique UUID for idOfLead.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, comparing the two objects.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method can correctly determine that two objects are not equal if their idOfLead values are different. This test is significant for maintaining the integrity of the equality check based on the idOfLead field.

Scenario 6: Equality check with two identical LeadClickOnPromotionalLink objects

Details:  
  TestName: equalsWithIdenticalObjects
  Description: This test checks that the equals method returns true when comparing two LeadClickOnPromotionalLink objects with the same idOfLead value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink with the same UUID for idOfLead.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, comparing the two objects.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns true.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the equals method identifies two objects as equal if their idOfLead fields match. This test is crucial for verifying the consistency and reliability of the equals method when the objects being compared have the same state.

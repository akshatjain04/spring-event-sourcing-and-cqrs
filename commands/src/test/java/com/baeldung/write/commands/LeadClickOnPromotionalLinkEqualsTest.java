================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Potential Null Pointer Exception
Issue: If idOfLead is null, a null pointer exception might be thrown.
Solution: Add null checks across your codebase to prevent possible Null Pointer Exceptions. In Java 8 and onwards, you can use Optional to avoid such issues.

Vulnerability: Poor Class Design/Domain Model
Issue: Inappropriate class casting might lead to ClassCastException. The equals method should be able to compare against any type of Object, but explicit casting enforces it to be of type LeadClickOnPromotionalLink only.
Solution: Replace the explicit class casting with a type check. Check if the object is an instance of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink rather than calling getClass(). In this way, if the object is not of type LeadClickOnPromotionalLink, it will prevent a possible ClassCastException.

Vulnerability: Inconsistent Equals Method
Issue: The equals method is the fundamental method in Java, and it should follow its contract. Always override hashCode() if equals() is overridden to maintain the general contract for the hashCode method, which states that equal objects must have equal hash codes.
Solution: Override hashCode() method whenever equals() is overridden.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing with identical objects

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithIdenticalObjects
  Description: This test ensures that the method returns true when two identical objects are compared.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object and assign another reference to it.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on these two reference objects.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is true.
Validation: 
  As both references point to the same object, the equals method should always return true. This test helps in validating the very basic and essential functionality of the equals method. 

Scenario 2: Testing with null

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNull
  Description: This test is meant to check that the method returns false when comparing with a null object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on this object, passing in null.
  Assert: Ensure that the returned value is false.
Validation:
  An object can never be equal to null. Thus, this test proves that the equals method correctly handles the case where the comparison object is null.

Scenario 3: Testing with different classes

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClasses
  Description: This test verifies that the method returns false when an object is compared with an object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different class objects.
  Act: Invoke the equals method and pass one of the objects.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is false.
Validation:
  An object cannot be equal to an object of a completely different class. This test scenario ensures that equals method is working appropriately when objects of different classes are compared.

Scenario 4: Testing with same class but different idOfLead

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameClassDifferentIdofLead
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly recognizes objects of the same class but different idOfLead as unequal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two objects of the same class but with different idOfLead.
  Act: Invoke the equals method and pass one of the objects.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is false.
Validation:
  Two objects of the same class, but with different idOfLead, cannot be equal. Therefore, this validation ensures correct functionality of the equals method when comparing such objects.

Scenario 5: Testing with same class and same idOfLead

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameClassSameIdofLead
  Description: This test verifies if the equals method correctly recognizes objects of the same class and same idOfLead as equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two objects of the same class and with the same idOfLead.
  Act: Invoke the equals method and pass one of the objects.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is true.
Validation:
  Two objects of the same class and with the same idOfLead are considered equal. This test case validates the equals method functionality when such objects are compared.

    The error does not occur due to an issue with these test cases, but due to an environment setup issue.
    The error message indicates a failure in resolving dependencies, which could be due to various reasons such as
    network connectivity problems, incorrect versions of dependencies, or misconfigured artifact repositories.
    Hence no changes are needed in these test cases. The environment setup issue should be resolved to run these tests.

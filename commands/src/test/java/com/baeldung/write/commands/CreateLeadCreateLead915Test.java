================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure [CWE-200]
Issue: The 'name' field could contain sensitive information (such as Personally Identifiable Information or PII) that, if mishandled, can lead to privacy violation issues.
Solution: Ensure that the 'name' data is treated appropriately at all times. If it holds sensitive information, consider encryption or other protective measures during storage and transmission. Security controls such as access control, logging, and monitoring should also be in place.

================================================================================
SCENARIO 1: Verify CreateLead with Valid Name
Details:
  TestName: createLeadWithValidName
  Description: This test ensures that the CreateLead method functions properly when supplied with a valid name. A successful execution will initialize the 'name' parameter correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Specify a valid 'name parameter'. 
    Act: Invoke the CreateLead method with the valid name.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the name is correctly assigned.
  Validation: Confirm that the name is assigned accurately, signifying that the CreateLead method works correctly when provided with valid input. This is significant as it tests the core functionality of the method.

SCENARIO 2: Verify CreateLead with Empty Name
Details:
  TestName: createLeadWithEmptyName
  Description: This test will check the behaviour of the CreateLead method when provided an empty string as a name. Since the name is a critical field, the method should handle this edge case appropriately.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Specify an empty string as 'name'. 
    Act: Invoke the CreateLead method with the empty name.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check proper handling of this edge case.
  Validation: This test verifies if the CreateLead method correctly handles an empty input. This is an important front-end validation scenario.

SCENARIO 3: Verify CreateLead with Null Name
Details:
  TestName: createLeadWithNullName
  Description: This test aims to check the behaviour of the CreateLead method when supplied with a null value as name. Considering name is required, the method should handle null input correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Specify 'name' as null.
    Act: Invoke the CreateLead method with null as name.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method handles null inputs correctly.
  Validation: The validation of this test ensures that the CreateLead method can handle null inputs properly by initiating necessary error handling. This is critical as it tests the robustness of the method against edge scenarios.

SCENARIO 4: Verify CreateLead with Long Name
Details:
  TestName: createLeadWithLongName
  Description: The test is designed to check for the CreateLead method response when a very long name is provided. The method should be able to handle such an edge case effectively.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: Prepare a very long 'name' string.
    Act: Invoke the CreateLead method with the long name string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method can handle unusually lengthy string inputs.
  Validation: The validation checks if the CreateLead method handles long string inputs effectively. This verifies the method's resilience against not-so-common scenarios.

NOTE: The test is expected to be working fine, but it's imperative to set up the correct infrastructure for the project before running the tests. According to the error log, the problem could be related to the project dependencies. Therefore, before running these tests, it is necessary to solve the issue with the infrastructure and dependencies of the project.

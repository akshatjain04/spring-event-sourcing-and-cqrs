================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Insecure Direct Object References
Issue: Exposing internal implementation objects to the user can lead to unauthorized data manipulation or access. In the present case, the UUID of a lead is directly accessible and modifiable.
Solution: Perform access control checks before handling requests for these objects. Use indirect references to these objects to prevent exposure of their IDs.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: If an exception is thrown, the stack trace or exception message may expose sensitive information.
Solution: Handle exceptions within the method. Do not propagate them up the stack, especially unhandled, which might leak sensitive data to the console or log files.

================================================================================
"""
 Scenario 1: Valid UUID as ID
Details:  
  TestName: setValidUUID
  Description: This test will validate if it can set the UUID value correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a UUID value.
  Act: Invoke setIdOfLead with the UUID created earlier.
  Assert: We run an assertion to confirm if idOfLead is equal to the UUID set.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method setIdOfLead correctly sets the UUID value. This test is significant in context verifying the correctness of a UUID value set to idOfLead.

 Scenario 2: Null UUID as ID
Details:  
  TestName: setNullUUID
  Description: This test will ascertain how setIdOfLead method behaves when called with a null UUID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a null UUID value.
  Act: Invoke setIdOfLead with null.
  Assert: Run an assertion to check if idOfLead is null.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method setIdOfLead can handle and accurately represent a null UUID. This is crucial as we want to ensure our application can correctly handle null values, preventing any unexpected NullPointerExceptions.

  Scenario 3: Duplication of UUID
  Details:  
    TestName: setDuplicateUUID
    Description: This test is to check the behavior of the method when we try to set an already existing UUID value as an ID.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a UUID value and set it as idOfLead.
    Act: Invoke setIdOfLead again with the UUID.
    Assert: Check if idOfLead is equal to the UUID.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the method setIdOfLead will overwrite the current UUID with a duplicate UUID. This is important to ensure consistency in our program's behavior.

  Scenario 4: UUID Format Error
  Details:  
    TestName: setEmptyUUID
    Description: This test will check the behavior of the setIdOfLead method when an invalid UUID is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a UUID with invalid format.
    Act: Invoke setIdOfLead with invalid UUID.
    Assert: Check if IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the method setIdOfLead throws a specific exception when an invalid UUID is passed. This is important to prevent injecting faulty data into our program.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-285: Improper Authorization
Issue: The setIdOfLead method could be vulnerable to insecure direct object reference if the UUIDs are guessable and any user can set the ID for any lead. The function does not seem to check if the current user has the permission to set the ID of a lead.
Solution: Ensure authorization checks are in place before allowing the operation. Implement access controls that are commensurate with the classification or sensitivity of the information involved.

Vulnerability: CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable
Issue: If a read operation were performed on 'idOfLead' before this method is ever called or 'idOfLead' is optional, there might be a chance 'idOfLead' is uninitialized at the point of usage.
Solution: Make sure the variable 'idOfLead' is initialized during declaration or make mandatory to call setIdOfLead method before usage of 'idOfLead' variable.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Check if the Method Sets Valid UUIDs Correctly

Details:  
  TestName: setIdOfLeadWithValidUUID
  Description: This test is meant to validate if the setIdOfLead method correctly sets the id of the lead when provided a valid UUID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class where setIdOfLead method resides, and generate a random UUID.
  Act: Call setIdOfLead method with the generated UUID.
  Assert: Get the idOfLead from the instance, compare if it is the same as the UUID set.
Validation: 
  This test is meant to validate the correctness of the setIdOfLead method's basic functionality - setting a valid UUID. If the test passes, this means the idOfLead has been set correctly, confirming the method's ability to handle a valid UUID.

Scenario 2: Set a New UUID Value After Another UUID Has Already Been Set

Details:
  TestName: setIdOfLeadWithSecondUUID
  Description: Validate whether the setIdOfLead method correctly overwrites the id of the lead when a second UUID is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class, generate two random UUIDs.
  Act: Call setIdOfLead method first with the first UUID, and then with the second UUID.
  Assert: Get the idOfLead from the instance, compare if it is the same as the second UUID set.
Validation:
  This test verifies whether the setIdOfLead method can correctly handle the cases when a UUID is set after another UUID has been set. If the test passes, it demonstrates that the method is able to correctly overwrite the idOfLead.

Scenario 3: Attempt to Set a Null UUID

Details:
  TestName: setIdOfLeadWithNullUUID
  Description: Validate the behavior of the setIdOfLead method when a null UUID is given.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class.
  Act: Call the setIdOfLead method with null.
  Assert: Check if the idOfLead in the instance is null or catch any exception if the null UUID is not allowed.
Validation:
  This test aims to verify if the method can handle null UUIDs or even whether null UUIDs are allowed to be set. If the test passes, it confirms the setIdOfLead method's ability to correctly deal with edge cases like setting null UUIDs.

/* 
Before running this test, make sure the setIdOfLead method throws a NullPointerException when a null argument is passed. Update the setIdOfLead method as follows:

public void setIdOfLead(final UUID idOfLead) {
    if(idOfLead == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("idOfLead cannot be null");
    }
    this.idOfLead = idOfLead;
}

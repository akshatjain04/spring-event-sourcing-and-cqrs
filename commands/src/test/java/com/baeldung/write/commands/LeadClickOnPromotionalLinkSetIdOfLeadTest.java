ROOST_METHOD_HASH=setIdOfLead_b4a4f46ab3
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=setIdOfLead_5031dee72d

Scenario 1: Setting a valid UUID as the ID of lead

Details:
  TestName: setValidUuidAsIdOfLead
  Description: This test ensures that a valid UUID can be set as the ID of the lead without exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid UUID instance.
  Act: Call setIdOfLead with the valid UUID instance.
  Assert: Verify that the idOfLead field is set to the provided UUID instance.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the idOfLead field is correctly assigned the value of the valid UUID, which is significant to ensure the entity is correctly identified in the system.

Scenario 2: Setting a null UUID as the ID of lead

Details:
  TestName: setNullUuidAsIdOfLead
  Description: This test checks the behavior of setIdOfLead when null is passed as the parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a null UUID reference.
  Act: Call setIdOfLead with the null reference.
  Assert: Verify that the idOfLead field is set to null.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the method accepts null as a valid input, which is significant for cases where the lead ID needs to be unset or is not yet assigned.

Scenario 3: Setting a new UUID as the ID of lead when an existing UUID is already set

Details:
  TestName: updateIdOfLeadWithNewUuid
  Description: This test ensures that the idOfLead field can be updated with a new UUID when it already has an existing UUID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two distinct UUID instances and set the idOfLead field with the first UUID.
  Act: Call setIdOfLead with the second UUID instance.
  Assert: Verify that the idOfLead field is updated to the second UUID instance.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the method correctly updates the idOfLead field, which is critical for maintaining the integrity of the lead entity's identity when changes are required.

Scenario 4: Setting the same UUID as the ID of lead when it is already set to this UUID

Details:
  TestName: setIdOfLeadWithSameUuid
  Description: This test verifies that setting the idOfLead field with the same UUID it already holds does not cause any issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a UUID instance and set the idOfLead field with this UUID.
  Act: Call setIdOfLead with the same UUID instance.
  Assert: Verify that the idOfLead field remains unchanged and is still set to the original UUID instance.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that redundant calls with the same UUID do not alter the state of the idOfLead field, which is important for avoiding unnecessary processing or side effects.

Scenario 5: Setting a UUID as the ID of lead in a multithreaded environment

Details:
  TestName: concurrentSetIdOfLeadWithDifferentUuids
  Description: This test checks the thread-safety of the setIdOfLead method when called concurrently with different UUIDs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple threads, each with its own unique UUID instance.
  Act: Each thread calls setIdOfLead with its unique UUID concurrently.
  Assert: Verify that the idOfLead field is equal to one of the UUIDs set by the threads.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for thread-safety and ensures that the idOfLead field can safely be set in a concurrent environment, which is crucial for applications that may modify entity IDs in a multithreaded context.

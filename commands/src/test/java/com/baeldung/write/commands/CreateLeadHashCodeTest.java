ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_5a2657087a

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Potential Null Pointer Exception
Issue: The code attempts to access a method of a potentially null object, which could lead to a Null Pointer Exception if the object is not initialized.
Solution: Implement a null check before calling any methods on the 'name' object.

Vulnerability: Hash Collision DoS (Denial of Service)
Issue: If the 'hashCode' method is used inappropriately, such as in HashMaps with user-provided data, this could increase the risk of DoS attacks via hash collisions. An attacker could send specific data to generate the same hash code, causing significant performance degradation.
Solution: Ensure the usage of 'hashCode' does not rely on user-provided, untrusted data. If necessary, consider customizing the hash function or using built-in security-enhanced collections.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test for default hash code value when the name is null

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeForNullNameValue
    Description: This test is meant to check the hashcode value when the name is null. The expected value should be 1 which is the initial value of the result. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: We don't have anything to arrange because the method doesn't require any parameters. 
    Act: Invoke the method with the name being null.
    Assert: Assert that the return value is equal to 1.
  Validation: 
    The assertion is verifying that in scenarios when name is null, hashcode is equal to the result's initial value which is 1. This can help in identifying and handling objects where the name is yet to be assigned.

  Scenario 2: Test for positive hashcode value when the name is not null 

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeForNonNullName
    Description: This test is designed to check the hashcode value when the name contains a valid string. The hashcode will depend on the prime number, current result and the hash of the name.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement needed as the parameters are not being passed directly to the method.
    Act: Invoke the method with a name assigned to a non-empty string.
    Assert: Assert that the return value is higher than 1.
  Validation: 
    This test checks the normal flow of the hashcode method when an object has been assigned a name. It helps test this specific behavior to ensure uniqueness is maintained in hashcodes.

  Scenario 3: Test similar hashcode for identical string values 

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeSameForIdenticalNames
    Description: Two objects with identical names should return the same hashcode.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement needed as the parameters are not being passed directly to the method.
    Act: Invoke the method for two separate objects, both with identical name values.
    Assert: Assert that the return value is the same for both objects.
  Validation: 
    This test ensures that the hash function behaves as expected in returning identical hashes for identical data. It also provides assurance about the consistency of the hash function.

  Scenario 4: Test differing hashcode for non-identical string values 

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeDifferentForNonIdenticalNames
    Description: Two objects with different names should return different hashcodes.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement needed. 
    Act: Invoke the method for two objects, each with a different name value.
    Assert: Assert that the two returned hashcodes are not equal.
  Validation: 
    This test checks the uniqueness property of the hash function. It verifies that different data should return different hashcodes, which aids in object identification and retrieval.

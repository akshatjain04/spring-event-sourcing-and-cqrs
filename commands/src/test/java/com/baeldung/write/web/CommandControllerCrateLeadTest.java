ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=crateLead_85433dfe14

Scenario 1: Successful creation of a lead

Details:  
  TestName: successfulLeadCreation
  Description: This test verifies that the crateLead method successfully creates a lead and saves the corresponding event in the event store.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock for the EventStore and a valid CreateLead command object.
  Act: Call the crateLead method with the valid CreateLead command object.
  Assert: Verify that the event store's save method is called with a LeadCreated event.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the event store contains the newly created LeadCreated event. This test is significant as it ensures that leads can be successfully created and their creation events are stored correctly.

Scenario 2: Lead creation with invalid data

Details:  
  TestName: leadCreationWithInvalidData
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the crateLead method when provided with an invalid CreateLead command object (violating @Valid constraints).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock for the EventStore and an invalid CreateLead command object (e.g., with a null or empty name).
  Act: Attempt to call the crateLead method with the invalid CreateLead command object.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown due to the invalid input.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the method throws an exception when invalid data is provided, validating the enforcement of input validation constraints.

Scenario 3: Event store failure during lead creation

Details:  
  TestName: eventStoreFailureDuringLeadCreation
  Description: This test ensures that the crateLead method handles exceptions thrown by the event store when attempting to save a new lead event.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock for the EventStore that throws an exception when the save method is called, and a valid CreateLead command object.
  Act: Call the crateLead method with the valid CreateLead command object.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be caught and handled appropriately (depending on the application's error handling strategy).
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the method handles event store failures gracefully. This is important for ensuring the robustness of the lead creation process in the face of external service failures.

Scenario 4: Lead creation with null command object

Details:  
  TestName: leadCreationWithNullCommand
  Description: This scenario tests the crateLead method's response when provided with a null CreateLead command object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock for the EventStore.
  Act: Call the crateLead method with a null CreateLead command object.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown due to the null input.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method throws an exception when null input is provided. This test ensures that the method is safeguarded against null inputs, which could lead to null pointer exceptions and application crashes.

Scenario 5: Lead creation with existing lead data

Details:  
  TestName: leadCreationWithExistingLeadData
  Description: This test examines the crateLead method's behavior when a lead with the same details already exists in the system (assuming the event store can check for duplicates).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock for the EventStore that simulates the existence of a duplicate lead and a valid CreateLead command object with duplicate data.
  Act: Call the crateLead method with the valid CreateLead command object.
  Assert: Verify that the event store's save method is not called or an exception is thrown, indicating a duplication error.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the method does not allow the creation of duplicate leads. This test is significant as it checks the application's ability to prevent data duplication and maintain data integrity.
